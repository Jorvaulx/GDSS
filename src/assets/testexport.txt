Traditional pipeline leak locating methods require that geophones have to be placed on the pipe wall. While if the exact location of the pipeline is unknown, the leaks may not be identified accurately. To solve this problem, considering the characteristics of pipeline leak, a continuous random seismic source model is proposed and geological models are established. Based on the two dimensional (2D) viscoacoustic equations and the staggered grid finite-difference (FD) algorithm, the microseismic wave field generated by a leaking pipe is modeled. Cross-correlation analysis and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm are employed to obtain the time difference and the leak location. Analysis and discussions of the effects of number of recorded traces, survey layout, and offset and trace interval on the accuracy of the estimated location are also conducted. Simulation and data field experiment results indicate that: (1) A continuous random source can realistically represent the leak microseismic wave field in a simulation using 2D viscoacoustic equations and staggered grid FD algorithm. (2) For the leak microseismic wave field, the cross-correlation method is effective for calculating time difference of the direct wave relative to the reference trace. However, outside the refraction blind zone, accuracy of the time difference is reduced by the effects of refracted wave. (3) The SA algorithm based upon time difference, helps to identify the leak location effectively, even in the presence of noise. Estimation of the horizontal distance is more accurate than that of the depth, and the locating errors increase with increasing number of traces and offset. Moreover, in the refraction blind zone, trace interval has almost no impact on the accuracy of the location estimate. And the symmetrical array provides a higher estimate accuracy than the asymmetrical array. (4) The acquisition method of time difference based on the microseismic theory and SA algorithm has a great potential for locating underground pipelines leak from an array located on the ground surface.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lekmine, G</author><author>Auradou, H</author><author>Pessel, M</author><author>Rayner, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of tracer plume transport parameters in 2D saturated porous media by cross-borehole ERT imaging</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>291-305</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Cross-borehole ERT imaging</keyword><keyword>Groundwater contaminant</keyword><keyword>Tracer test experiments</keyword><keyword>Transport in porous media</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.024</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301908</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Cross-borehole ERT imaging was tested to quantify the average velocity and transport parameters of tracer plumes in saturated porous media. Seven tracer tests were performed at different flow rates and monitored by either a vertical or horizontal dipole-dipole ERT sequence. These sequences were tested to reconstruct the shape and temporally follow the spread of the tracer plumes through a background regularization procedure. Data sets were inverted with the same inversion parameters and 2D model sections of resistivity ratios were converted to tracer concentrations. Both array types provided an accurate estimation of the average pore velocity vz. The total mass Mtot recovered was always overestimated by the horizontal dipole-dipole and underestimated by the vertical dipole-dipole. The vertical dipole-dipole was however reliable to quantify the longitudinal dispersivity λz, while the horizontal dipole-dipole returned better estimation for the transverse component λx. λ and Mtot were mainly influenced by the 2D distribution of the cumulated electrical sensitivity and the Shadow Effects induced by the third dimension. The size reduction of the edge of the plume was also related to the inability of the inversion process to reconstruct sharp resistivity contrasts at the interface. Smoothing was counterbalanced by a non-realistic rise of the ERT concentrations around the centre of mass returning overpredicted total masses. A sensitivity analysis on the cementation factor m and the porosity ϕ demonstrated that a change in one of these parameters by 8% involved non negligible variations by 30 and 40% of the dispersion coefficients and mass recovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sapia, Vincenzo</author><author>Baccheschi, Paola</author><author>Villani, Fabio</author><author>Taroni, Matteo</author><author>Marchetti, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multidisciplinary geophysical approach to map a disposal site: The Ponza island case study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>264-274</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Capacitive coupled resistivity data</keyword><keyword>Disposal site</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Magnetometry</keyword><keyword>Ponza</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301301</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and magnetometric surveys are extensively used for environmental investigations of uncontrolled landfills, where the presence of waste with potential contaminants and metal objects requires a detailed characterization and monitoring of their subsurface location. Capacitively-coupled resistivity (CCR) measurements applied for similar environmental studies are far less used. In this study, we show the results and discuss the advantages of a combined application of ERT, CCR and magnetometric surveys applied to the characterization of the disposal site of Mt. Pagliaro, in the island of Ponza (central Italy). The survey area is located on volcanic deposits, which characterize the low resistive geological bedrock. We acquired four CCR profiles and five ERT profiles in addition to a magnetic survey covering a total area of about 7000 m2. The recovered smooth resistivity models suggest the presence of a shallow resistive layer (ρ &amp;gt; 75 Ωm) of variable thickness (2.0–6.0 m), overlying a relatively low-resistive layer, which we interpret as the electrical response of the volcanic bedrock. This interpretation is supported by few shallow boreholes and field observation in the northern part of the landfill area. The magnetic maps show three suspicious dipolar magnetic anomalies, probably ascribed to the presence of a high concentration of buried ferrous waste. Several small-scale dipolar anomalies have been interpreted as due to the presence of sparse and shallow metal objects within the waste material. Due to the resistivity models' smoothness, to improve the characterization of the interface between the bedrock and the waste material we performed a statistical analysis of the resistivity data. Following the philosophy of the steepest gradient method, we found a significative change in resistivity computed on an averaged depth resistivity function of the ERT data. Accordingly, we classify two distinct units: a) an upper unit, with resistivity &amp;gt; 75 Ωm, which we assigned to the coarse waste and dry soil materials; and b) a lower unit, with resistivity &amp;lt; 75 Ωm, which we assigned to the volcanic deposits. We chose the 75 Ωm value as representative of the top-bedrock\waste interface and we interpolated this boundary from both the ERT and the CCR profiles to reconstruct a smooth 3D representation of the top bedrock within the landfill area. This allowed us to evaluate the total volume of the waste material to be about 35,000 m3.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nazaruddin, Dony Adriansyah</author><author>Amiruzan, Zafirah Sakinah</author><author>Hussin, Hamzah</author><author>Jafar, Mohamad Taufiq Mohd</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated geological and multi-electrode resistivity surveys for groundwater investigation in Kampung Rahmat village and its vicinity, Jeli district, Kelantan, Malaysia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>23-32</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Aquifer</keyword><keyword>Geological survey</keyword><keyword>Groundwater exploration</keyword><keyword>Jeli district</keyword><keyword>Kelantan</keyword><keyword>Multi-electrode resistivity method</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.01.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300344</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The integration of geological and multi-electrode resistivity surveys has been carried out in Kampung Rahmat village and its vicinity, in Jeli district, Kelantan, Malaysia as part of the groundwater resources exploration for rural water supply. A geological survey in the study area has shown that the area consists of some topographic units: mountainous area, hilly area, and low-lying to undulating area. The study area is lithologically composed of granitic rocks (megacrystic biotite granite porphyry) overlain by Quaternary alluvial deposits (with weathered granite). For the multi-electrode resistivity survey, the Schlumberger array with a maximum electrode spread of 200 m was conducted by employing three resistivity survey lines, where data were collected by using the ABEM Terrameter SAS 4000 and ABEM LUND ES464 electrode selector system, and processed by using RES2DINV software. The images were presented in the form of two-dimensional (2D) resistivity profiles providing a clear view of the distribution of granitic rock basement and alluvial deposits (with the weathered granite) as well as potential groundwater zones. The results show that the study area has potential groundwater resources existing in the alluvium which become the unconfined aquifers. The combination between these two methods is reliable and successful in identifying potentially favorable zones for obtaining groundwater in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clémence, Houzé</author><author>Marc, Pessel</author><author>Véronique, Durand</author><author>Toihir, Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring an artificial tracer test within streambed sediments with time lapse underwater 3D ERT</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>158-169</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>3D electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Hyporheic zone</keyword><keyword>Solute tracer study</keyword><keyword>Streambed sediments</keyword><keyword>Time lapse monitoring</keyword><keyword>Underwater geophysics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301349</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The stream-aquifer interface is considered a hotspot for environmental and ecological issues. Due to their complexity, the exchange mechanisms occurring between groundwater and surface water at this interface are not yet fully understood. Many studies have focused on the characterization of the two-dimensional distribution of an artificial tracer (generally injected into the stream) within and outside the streambed, but there is insufficient information about the 3D spatial distribution of the tracer fluxes and their temporal variations. We monitored the transport of an artificial solute tracer transport with 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in order to improve the 3D spatial resolution in the imaging of the first tens of centimeters of streambed sediments and propose an innovative approach of the three-dimensional and temporal observation of the water fluxes. The hydro-geophysical field measurements were made on a small stream located within the Orgeval watershed (Seine et Marne, France). Using a resistivimeter connected to 180 electrodes, 3D electrical resistivity tomograms were made on a riverbed section, as a brine tracer was injected directly into the hyporheic zone. Before the tracer monitoring, the static 3D resistivity tomograms were consistent with the lithological heterogeneities identified at the site. However, this study defines some prerequisites to high-resolution 3D underwater resistivity measurements: for instance, a precise knowledge of an eventual weak electrode contact and a spatial resolution identical in every spatial direction. First results show a rapid development and persistence of a conductive plume around the injection point which disappears progressively after the injection. Within the sediments top layer, preferential flowpaths were highlighted due to the highly heterogeneous medium and hydraulic conductivity. The riverbed topography showed some pool-riffle sequences which conduct the formation of local entering and exiting zones. It seems clear that riverbed heterogeneities drive some local exchanges between surface water and pore water, despite the gaining condition of the stream. Moreover, inversion and data processing appear very sensitive to the boundary condition variations, such as the thickness and the resistivity of the water layer. This makes a quantitative interpretation of tracer fluxes within the hyporheic zone difficult. We demonstrate that for this type of study, knowledge of these conditions and precise monitoring of their fluctuations in time are required.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Özel, Sevda</author><author>Yılmaz, Ali</author><author>Emin Candansayar, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The examination of the spread of the leachates coming out of a solid waste disposal area on the ground with geophysical and geochemical methods (Sivas, Turkey)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>40-49</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>2D, 3D, inversion</keyword><keyword>Apparent electromagnetic conductivity</keyword><keyword>DCR</keyword><keyword>Disposal area</keyword><keyword>Heavy metal</keyword><keyword>Leachate</keyword><keyword>Pollution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.01.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300356</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This study has been conducted in the irregular solid waste disposal area in the city of Sivas. The pollution spread formed by the leachates coming out of the disposal area has been examined with geophysical and geochemical works in this study. For this reason, the spread of the leachate pollution expanding in different geological units at both sides of a creek on the ground has been examined. For this purpose, the pollution spread has been examined with the methods of Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) and Electromagnetic Conductivity (EMC) and soil analyses. In the DCR method, 2D inversion of each sounding-profile datum measured alongside the lines parallel to each other and 3D inversion of the data measured in all the lines have been used in the interpretations. Apparent conductivity map has been attained from EMC measurements. The results of heavy metal analyses in the soil samples taken alongside the Haçin Creek have been assessed with the Spider diagram method. It has been determined that the flow of the leachate from geophysical models is in a SE direction and towards Kızılırmak and it continues vertically deeper than 4 m. In addition, it has been understood that the flow direction of the leachate is inspected by the geological structures. It has been understood from the geochemical results that the pollution in the soil stems from the leachate. In this way, it has been observed that the underground and surface water resources in the territory are under the threat of the pollution occurring due to the leachate.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jinho</author><author>Lee, Kang-Hyun</author><author>Seo, Hyungjoon</author><author>Ryu, Jinwoo</author><author>Lee, In-Mo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of induced electrical polarization to identify soft ground/fractured rock conditions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>63-72</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>Chargeability</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>Fractured rock</keyword><keyword>Induced polarization</keyword><keyword>Soft ground</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.12.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306668</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This study attempted to evaluate the role and effectiveness of induced polarization (IP) along with electrical resistivity to identify soft ground/fractured rock. Theoretical studies as well as laboratory-scale experiments were conducted for this purpose. The theoretical study involved deriving the functional relationship between chargeability and influential variables. This was followed by performing a sensitivity analysis using the derived relationship to reveal that the size of narrow pores (r1) exerted the greatest influence on the chargeability followed by the salinity of the pore water (C0). In the laboratory test, a small-scale fractured rock zone was modeled using sandstone as a parent rock. The chargeability and resistivity were measured by changing the size of the joint aperture filled with tap water and/or sea water, the location of the fractured zone, and the thickness of the soil layer in a soil-rock multi-layered ground. The experimental study modeled the jointed zone between competent sandstone layers and indicated that the chargeability was mostly controlled by the size of the narrow pore (r1) of the surface sandstone and not by the porosity of the jointed zone. Hence, it was concluded that the chargeability did not significantly depend on the fractured characteristics of the jointed rock. It could be difficult to clearly distinguish as to whether the low resistivity value is caused by the sea water intrusion or by the increase in porosity of the fractured ground. However, the IP exploration can be effectively utilized to identify sea water intrusion since the chargeability decreased as the salinity of pore water increased. The experimental study on a soil-rock multi-layered ground indicated that the measured chargeability was controlled by the percentage of current flow that passed through the competent rock as well as by the narrow pore size of the rock itself. In conclusion, the ground condition could be easily identified by measuring the IP in conjunction with the electrical resistivity, and this increased the reliability of identifying the existence of sea water, layered ground, and/or the fractured rock.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tildy, Péter</author><author>Neducza, Boriszláv</author><author>Nagy, Péter</author><author>Kanli, Ali Ismet</author><author>Hegymegi, Csaba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time lapse 3D geoelectric measurements for monitoring of in-situ remediation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>99-113</pages><volume>136</volume><keywords><keyword>3D time lapse measurements</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)</keyword><keyword>Petro-physical modelling</keyword><keyword>Remediation monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.10.037</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116304682</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
In the last decade, different kinds of in-situ methods have been increasingly used for hydrocarbon contamination remediation due to their effectiveness. One of these techniques operates by injection of chemical oxidant solution to remove (degrade) the subsurface contaminants. Our aim was to develop a surface (non-destructive) measurement strategy to monitor oxidative in-situ remediation processes. The difficulties of the presented study originate from the small volume of conductive solution that can be used due to environmental considerations, the effect of conductive groundwater and the high clay content of the targeted layer. Therefore a site specific synthetic modelling was necessary for measurement design involving the results of preliminary 2D ERT measurements, electrical conductivity measurements of different active agents and expected resistivity changes calculated by soil resistivity modelling. The results of soil resistivity modelling have suggested that the reagent have complex effects on contaminated soils because of chemical biodegradation. As a result the plume of resistivity changes caused by the injected agent was determined showing strong fracturing effect because of the high pressure of injection. Based on the sophisticated tests and synthetic modelling 3D time-lapse geo-electric measurements were proven to provide a usable monitoring tool for in-situ remediation to help in-field design of such techniques.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bièvre, Grégory</author><author>Lacroix, Pascal</author><author>Oxarango, Laurent</author><author>Goutaland, David</author><author>Monnot, Guy</author><author>Fargier, Yannick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integration of geotechnical and geophysical techniques for the characterization of a small earth-filled canal dyke and the localization of water leakage</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Earth-filled canal dyke</keyword><keyword>Geometry</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Internal erosion</keyword><keyword>Leakage</keyword><keyword>Water head</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301325</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This paper investigates the combined use of extensive geotechnical, hydrogeological and geophysical techniques to assess a small earth dyke with a permanent hydraulic head, namely a canal embankment. The experimental site was chosen because of known issues regarding internal erosion and piping phenomena. Two leakages were visually located following the emptying of the canal prior to remediation works. The results showed a good agreement between the geophysical imaging techniques (Electrical Resistivity Tomography, P- and SH-waves Tomography) and the geotechnical data to detect the depth to the bedrock and its lateral variations. It appeared that surface waves might not be fully adapted for dyke investigation because of the particular geometry of the studied dyke, non-respectful of the 1D assumption, and which induced depth and velocity discrepancies retrieved from Rayleigh and Love waves inversion. The use of these classical prospecting techniques however did not allow to directly locate the two leakages within the studied earth dyke. The analysis of ambient vibration time series with a modified beam-forming algorithm allowed to localize the most energetic water flow prior to remediation works. It was not possible to detect the leakage after remediation works, suggesting that they efficiently contributed to significantly reduce the water flow. The second leakage was not detected probably because of a non-turbulent water flow, generating few energetic vibrations.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pallero, J L G</author><author>Fernández-Martínez, J L</author><author>Bonvalot, S</author><author>Fudym, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3D gravity inversion and uncertainty assessment of basement relief via Particle Swarm Optimization</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>338-350</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Nonlinear gravity inversion</keyword><keyword>Particle Swarm Optimization</keyword><keyword>Pyrenees–Argelès-Gazost</keyword><keyword>Sedimentary basin</keyword><keyword>Uncertainty assessment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301337</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Nonlinear gravity inversion in sedimentary basins is a classical problem in applied geophysics. Although a 2D approximation is widely used, 3D models have been also proposed to better take into account the basin geometry. A common nonlinear approach to this 3D problem consists in modeling the basin as a set of right rectangular prisms with prescribed density contrast, whose depths are the unknowns. Then, the problem is iteratively solved via local optimization techniques from an initial model computed using some simplifications or being estimated using prior geophysical models. Nevertheless, this kind of approach is highly dependent on the prior information that is used, and lacks from a correct solution appraisal (nonlinear uncertainty analysis). In this paper, we use the family of global Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizers for the 3D gravity inversion and model appraisal of the solution that is adopted for basement relief estimation in sedimentary basins. Synthetic and real cases are illustrated, showing that robust results are obtained. Therefore, PSO seems to be a very good alternative for 3D gravity inversion and uncertainty assessment of basement relief when used in a sampling while optimizing approach. That way important geological questions can be answered probabilistically in order to perform risk assessment in the decisions that are made.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martorana, R</author><author>Capizzi, P</author><author>D’Alessandro, A</author><author>Luzio, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of different sets of array configurations for multichannel 2D ERT acquisition</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>34-48</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>2D</keyword><keyword>Arrays</keyword><keyword>Multichannel</keyword><keyword>Multiple gradient</keyword><keyword>Resistivity</keyword><keyword>Resolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.12.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306425</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Traditional electrode arrays such Wenner-Schlumberger or dipole-dipole are still widely used thanks to their well-known properties but the array configurations are generally not optimized for multi-channel resistivity measures.

Synthetic datasets relating to four different arrays, dipole-dipole (DD), pole-dipole (PD), Wenner-Schlumberger (WS) and a modified version of multiple gradient (MG), have been made for a systematic comparison between 2D resistivity models and their inverted images. Different sets of array configurations generated from simple combinations of geometric parameters (potential dipole lengths and dipole separation factors) were tested with synthetic and field data sets, even considering the influence of errors and the acquisition velocity. The purpose is to establish array configurations capable to provide reliable results but, at the same time, not involving excessive survey costs, even linked to the acquiring time and therefore to the number of current dipoles used.

For DD, PD and WS arrays a progression of different datasets were considered increasing the number of current dipoles trying to get about the same amount of measures. A multi-coverage MG array configuration is proposed by increasing the lateral coverage and so the number of current dipoles. Noise simulating errors both on the electrode positions and on the electric potential was added.

The array configurations have been tested on field data acquired in the landfill site of Bellolampo (Palermo, Italy), to detect and locate the leachate plumes and to identify the HDPE bottom of the landfill.

The inversion results were compared using a quantitative analysis of data misfit, relative model resolution and model misfit. The results show that the trends of the first two parameters are linked on the array configuration and that a cumulative analysis of these parameters can help to choose the best array configuration in order to obtain a good resolution and reliability of a survey, according to generally short acquisition times.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boaga, Jacopo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The use of FDEM in hydrogeophysics: A review</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>36-46</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>EMI mapping</keyword><keyword>FDEM methods</keyword><keyword>Soil conductivity</keyword><keyword>Subsurface hydrology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301507</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Hydrogeophysics is a rapidly evolving discipline emerging from geophysical methods. Geophysical methods are nowadays able to illustrate not only the fabric and the structure of the underground, but also the subsurface processes that occur within it, as fluids dynamic and biogeochemical reactions. This is a growing wide inter-disciplinary field, specifically dedicated to revealing soil properties and monitoring processes of change due to soil/bio/atmosphere interactions. The discipline involves environmental, hydrological, agricultural research and counts application for several engineering purposes. The most frequently used techniques in the hydrogeophysical framework are the electric and electromagnetic methods because they are highly sensitive to soil physical properties such as texture, salinity, mineralogy, porosity and water content. Non-invasive techniques are applied in a number of problems related to characterization of subsurface hydrology and groundwater dynamic processes. Ground based methods, as electrical tomography, proved to obtain considerable resolution but they are difficult to extend to wider exploration purposes due to their logistical limitation. Methods that don't need electrical contact with soil can be, on the contrary, easily applied to broad areas. Among these methods, a rapidly growing role is played by frequency domain electro-magnetic (FDEM) survey. This is due thanks to the improvement of multi-frequency and multi-coils instrumentation, simple time-lapse repeatability, cheap and accurate topographical referencing, and the emerging development of inversion codes. From raw terrain apparent conductivity meter, FDEM survey is becoming a key tool for 3D soil characterization and dynamics observation in near surface hydrological studies. Dozens of papers are here summarized and presented, in order to describe the promising potential of the technique.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dai, Qianwei</author><author>Lin, Fangpeng</author><author>Wang, Xiaoping</author><author>Feng, Deshan</author><author>Bayless, Richard C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection of concrete dam leakage using an integrated geophysical technique based on flow-field fitting method</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>168-176</pages><volume>140</volume><keywords><keyword>Concrete dam</keyword><keyword>Flow-field fitting method</keyword><keyword>Leakage detection</keyword><keyword>Limitations and complements to flow-field fitting method</keyword><keyword>Resistivity logging method</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.03.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117303014</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
An integrated geophysical investigation was performed at S dam located at Dadu basin in China to assess the condition of the dam curtain. The key methodology of the integrated technique used was flow-field fitting method, which allowed identification of the hydraulic connections between the dam foundation and surface water sources (upstream and downstream), and location of the anomalous leakage outlets in the dam foundation. Limitations of the flow-field fitting method were complemented with resistivity logging to identify the internal erosion which had not yet developed into seepage pathways. The results of the flow-field fitting method and resistivity logging were consistent when compared with data provided by seismic tomography, borehole television, water injection test, and rock quality designation.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, Deqiang</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Revil, Andr??</author><author>Zuo, Yi</author><author>Hinton, John</author><author>Ren, Zhiyong Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical Monitoring of Hydrocarbon-Contaminated Soils Remediated with a Bioelectrochemical System</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><volume>50</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.est.6b00535</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Efficient noninvasive techniques are desired for monitoring the remediation process of contaminated soils. We applied the direct current resistivity technique to image conductivity changes in sandbox experiments where two sandy and clayey soils were initially contaminated with diesel hydrocarbon. The experiments were conducted over a 230 day period. The removal of hydrocarbon was enhanced by a bioelectrochemical system (BES) and the electrical potentials of the BES reactors were also monitored during the course of the experiment. We found that the variation in electrical conductivity shown in the tomograms correlate well with diesel removal from the sandy soil, but this is not the case with the clayey soil. The clayey soil is characterized by a larger specific surface area and therefore a larger surface conductivity. In sandy soil, the removal of the diesel and products from degradation leads to an increase in electrical conductivity during the first 69 days. This is expected since diesel is electrically insulating. For both soils, the activity of BES reactors is moderately imaged by the inverted conductivity tomogram of the reactor. An increase in current production by electrochemically active bacteria activity corresponds to an increase in conductivity of the reactor.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Mark R.</author><author>Buda, Anthony R.</author><author>Singha, Kamini</author><author>Folmar, Gordon J.</author><author>Elliott, Herschel A.</author><author>Schmidt, John P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging Hydrological Processes in Headwater Riparian Seeps with Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27618484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12461</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Delineating hydrologic and pedogenic factors influencing groundwater flow in riparian zones is central in understanding pathways of water and nutrient transport. In this study, we combined two-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) (depth of investigation approximately 2 m) with hydrometric monitoring to examine hydrological processes in the riparian area of FD-36, a small (0.4 km2) agricultural headwater basin in the Valley and Ridge region of east-central Pennsylvania. We selected two contrasting study sites, including a seep with groundwater discharge and an adjacent area lacking such seepage. Both sites were underlain by a fragipan at 0.6 m. We then monitored changes in electrical resistivity, shallow groundwater, and nitrate-N concentrations as a series of storms transitioned the landscape from dry to wet conditions. Time-lapse ERI revealed different resistivity patterns between seep and non-seep areas during the study period. Notably, the seep displayed strong resistivity reductions (∼60%) along a vertically aligned region of the soil profile, which coincided with strong upward hydraulic gradients recorded in a grid of nested piezometers (0.2- and 0.6-m depth). These patterns suggested a hydraulic connection between the seep and the nitrate-rich shallow groundwater system below the fragipan, which enabled groundwater and associated nitrate-N to discharge through the fragipan to the surface. In contrast, time-lapse ERI indicated no such connections in the non-seep area, with infiltrated rainwater presumably perched above the fragipan. Results highlight the value of pairing time-lapse ERI with hydrometric and water quality monitoring to illuminate possible groundwater and nutrient flow pathways to seeps in headwater riparian areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valaee, Morteza</author><author>Ayoubi, Shamsollah</author><author>Khormali, Farhad</author><author>Lu, Sheng Gao</author><author>Karimzadeh, Hamid Reza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using magnetic susceptibility to discriminate between soil moisture regimes in selected loess and loess-like soils in northern Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>23-30</pages><volume>127</volume><keywords><keyword>Iron forms</keyword><keyword>Loess soils</keyword><keyword>Magnetic measures</keyword><keyword>Northern Iran</keyword><keyword>Soil moisture regimes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.02.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116300362</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract This study used discriminant analysis to determine the efficacy of magnetic measures for discriminating between four soil moisture regimes in northern Iran. The study area was located on loess deposits and loess-like soils containing similar parent material. Four soil moisture regimes including aridic, xeric, udic, and aquic were selected. A total of 25 soil profiles were drug from each regime and composite soil samples were collected within the moisture control section. A set of magnetic measures including magnetic susceptibility at low (χlf) and high (χhf) frequencies, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), saturation isothermal remnant magnetization (SIRM), and isothermal remnant magnetization (IRM100 mT, IRM 20 mT) were measured in the laboratory. Dithionite citrate bicarbonate (Fed) and acid oxalate (Feo) contents of all soil samples were also determined. The lowest and highest χlf and χhf were observed in aquic and udic moisture regimes, respectively. A similar trend was obtained for Fed and Fed–Feo. The significant positive correlation between Fed and SIRM (r = 0.60; P &amp;lt; 0.01) suggested the formation of stable single domains (SSD) due to pedogenic processes. The results of discriminant analysis indicated that a combination of magnetic measures could successfully discriminate between the selected moisture regimes in the study area (average accuracy = 80%). It can thus be concluded that magnetic measures could be applied as a powerful indicator for differentiation of soil moisture regimes in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bellmunt, F</author><author>Marcuello, A</author><author>Ledo, J</author><author>Queralt, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capability of cross-hole electrical configurations for monitoring rapid plume migration experiments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>73-82</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Dataset optimization</keyword><keyword>Resistivity imaging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985115300628</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography is a useful tool in geotechnical, hydrogeological or fluid/gas plume migration studies.

We investigate how soil moisture is affected by daily transpiration using time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) on a highly instrumented ponderosa pine and the surrounding soil throughout the growing season.

As sap flow decreases during the night, the ground conductivity increases as the soil moisture is replenished. The mean and variance of the ground conductivity decreases into the summer dry season, indicating drier soil and smaller diel fluctuations in soil moisture as the summer progresses. Sap flow did not significantly decrease through the summer suggesting use of a water source deeper than 60 cm to maintain transpiration during times of shallow soil moisture depletion. ERI captured spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture on daily and seasonal timescales.

The groundwater level close to the toe front of the landslide was the lowest. The groundwater is recharged by the precipitation and generally drains to the toe front by seasonal springs along the sliding surface.

With developments in instrumentation and computational resources, the collection of large, non-conventional DC resistivity datasets has become commonplace. While the increased data content of these large datasets can significantly improve the resolution of inverse models, these datasets also present challenges for standard data quality control (QC) methodologies. Standard QC methodologies for DC resistivity datasets typically rely on our ability to decompose the dataset into 2D lines and/or reciprocal measurements. Non-conventional electrode geometries and the cost of collecting a large number of reciprocal measurements can severely limit the applicability of standard DC resistivity QC methodologies.

To address these limitations, we developed a more generalized data QC methodology which utilizes statistical analysis and classification tools. The merit of this methodology is illustrated using a field dataset collected in an underground potash mine and several synthetic examples. Results from these applications show that the methodology has the ability to identify and characterize highly noise-contaminated data from a number of different sources. The flexibility of the 4-stage methodology allows it be tailored to accommodate data from any type of DC resistivity survey and the use of statistical analysis and classification tools decreases the subjectivity of the process. Although this study focuses on the applicability of this methodology for DC resistivity data, it is potentially applicable to a variety of geophysical surveys.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Samgyu</author><author>Yi, Myeong-Jong</author><author>Kim, Jung-Ho</author><author>Shin, Seung Wook</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) monitoring for groundwater contamination in an uncontrolled landfill, South Korea</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>135</volume><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI)</keyword><keyword>Groundwater monitoring</keyword><keyword>Landfill leachate</keyword><keyword>Three-dimensional inversion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.07.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116301793</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
In the study area, uncontrolled landfill leachate is a serious cause of groundwater contamination that occurs extensively and rapidly following the rainy season. For this reason, the use of traditional hydrogeological monitoring methods using drilled wells is expensive and limited. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is suitable for monitoring groundwater contamination because this method helps quickly investigate a large site without the need for well drilling. The resistivity of the landfill leachate is lower than that of clean groundwater; based on this fact, we evaluated the diffusion of landfill leachate before and after the rainy season using 3-D ERI characterization. In addition, ERI results were compared with piezometric and hydrochemical data obtained from observation wells for the purpose of cross-validation. The groundwater monitoring results agreed with the 2-D and 3-D interpretation of ERI results. The electrical resistivity values of contaminated zones were lower than those of clean zones due to an abundance of ions or molecules in the groundwater. The resistivity boundary between contaminated and clean zones observed in the inverted 2-D and 3-D ERI sections was considered to be approximately 100 Ω-m. The low-resistivity anomaly of the contamination zones increased in extent after rainfall. The expansion was likely accelerated by groundwater movement and diffusion of the landfill leachate. Images of the change in electrical resistivity were helpful for characterization of the behavior. The two-directional behaviors of NE-SW and N-S trends were confirmed by the 3-D ratio images. It is therefore, considered that the ERI technique is excellent for imaging contaminated zones as well as monitoring the behaviors of landfill leachate in uncontrolled landfills.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gance, J.</author><author>Malet, J.

Spatially-distributed and high frequency observations of these hydrological processes are important for improving our understanding and prediction of landslide triggering. This work presents observed changes in electrical resistivity monitored at the Super-Sauze clayey landslide with the GEOMON4D resistivity instrument installed permanently on-site for a period of one year. A methodological framework for processing the raw measurement is proposed. It includes the filtering of the resistivity dataset, the correction of the effects of non-hydrological factors (sensitivity of the device, sensitivity to soil temperature and fluid conductivity, presence of fissures in the topsoil) on the filtered resistivity values. The interpretation is based on a statistical analysis to define possible relationships between the rainfall characteristics, the soil hydrological observations and the soil electrical resistivity response. During the monitoring period, no significant relationships between the electrical response and the measured hydrological parameters are evidenced. We discuss the limitations of the method due to the effect of heat exchange between the groundwater, the vadose zone water and the rainwater that hides the variations of resistivity due to variations of the soil water content. We demonstrate that despite the absence of hydrogeophysical information for the vadose zone, the sensitivity of electrical resistivity monitoring to temperature variations allows imaging water fluxes in the saturated zone and highlighting the existence of matrix and preferential flows that does not occur at the same time and for the same duration. We conclude on the necessity to combine electrical resistivity measurements with distributed soil temperature measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mary, Benjamin</author><author>Saracco, Ginette</author><author>Peyras, Laurent</author><author>Vennetier, Michel</author><author>Mériaux, Patrice</author><author>Camerlynck, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping tree root system in dikes using induced polarization: Focus on the influence of soil water content</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.05.005</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this study, we assessed induced polarization as potential non-destructive method for root detection in dike embankments. We used both laboratory and field experiment to describe the electrical signal with a focus on soil water content.

We hypothesized that preferential water zone absorption near the roots could, in some conditions, contribute to locate them. During the laboratory experiments, we compared the response of containers filled with the same homogeneous silty clay bare material, and without (A) or with freshly cut root (B) at different levels of soil water content. Resistivity and phase variations with soil water content indicated that it was preferable to work in dry conditions since the contrast was higher. Interactions and overlapping between polarization effects of both root and soil made it difficult to interpret first chargeability maps. This led us to study temporal-spatial variations by considering the dynamics of water absorption during a field experiment. High resolution time lapses images showed a correlation between root location and complex resistivity anomalies. Although these first results have to be confirmed by further measurements, induced polarization seems to add useful information to interpret anomalies produced by woody roots.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merritt, A J</author><author>Chambers, J E</author><author>Wilkinson, P B</author><author>West, L J</author><author>Murphy, W</author><author>Gunn, D</author><author>Uhlemann, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement and modelling of moisture—electrical resistivity relationship of fine-grained unsaturated soils and electrical anisotropy</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>155-165</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)</keyword><keyword>Electropetrophysics</keyword><keyword>Landslide study</keyword><keyword>Soil testing</keyword><keyword>Unsaturated petrophysical relationships</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985115300574</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract A methodology for developing resistivity-moisture content relationships of materials associated with a clayey landslide is presented. Key elements of the methodology include sample selection and preparation, laboratory measurement of resistivity with changing moisture content, and the derivation of models describing the relationship between resistivity and moisture content.  Laboratory resistivity measurements show that the techniques utilised (samples and square array) have considerable potential as a means of electropetrophysical calibration of engineering soils and weak rock. Experimental electrical resistivity results show a hierarchy of values dependent on sample lithology, with silty clay exhibiting the lowest resistivities, followed by siltstones and sands, which return the highest resistivities. In addition, finer grained samples show a greater degree of anisotropy between measurement orientations than coarser grained samples.  However, suitability of results in light of issues such as sample cracking and electrical conduction must be identified and accounted for if the results are to be accurately up-scaled to inverted model resistivity results. The existence of directional anisotropy makes model calibration curve selection more difficult due to variability in the range of measured laboratory resistances.  The use of larger measurement array size means that experimental data will be more representative of bulk lithological properties. In addition, use of electrodes with a relatively high surface area (wide diameter) help maintain low contact resistances and repeat measurement error, relative to narrow electrodes.  Variation exists between the fit of experimental data and petrophysical models. Model fit is best for clay-dominated samples but fits less well for sand-dominated samples. Waxman–Smits equation is appropriately applied in this investigation as all samples have considerable clay mineral content, as is shown in non-negligible CEC results. The incorporation of pressure plate suction measurements on samples, allows suction dissipation to be quantified and evaluated alongside moisture content and electrical resistivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkmann, J</author><author>Klitzsch, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of low frequency polarization models using well characterized sintered porous glass samples</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>39-53</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Low frequency polarization models</keyword><keyword>Spectral induced polarization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092698511530063X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding low frequency complex conductivity measurements of rocks. The relevant publications study these methods in two different ways: On the one hand, petrophysical interpretation has been improved in terms of theoretical approaches. These approaches are either modifications of pore size related membrane polarization concepts or rely on grain size related polarization models in combination with semi-empirical model function parameterizations. On the other hand, extensive petrophysical studies provide insight in dependencies of IS parameters on structural and electrochemical rock properties. We aim at assessing the results of published theoretical and experimental findings for a reference system, consisting of sintered porous glass samples. Thereby, we benefit from well characterized samples, which allow for direct tests of theoretical predictions and empirical relations. We find that: (1) The correlation σ ″ ~ Sm is stronger than σ ″ ~ Spor for a wide range of fluid conductivities and frequencies above 1 Hz. (2) Correlation coefficients for the imaginary conductivity to inner surface area relations are strongly frequency dependent. (3) Normalized chargeability, obtained by fitting a Cole–Cole model to the spectral data, provides a fair alternative to single frequency information. (4) Correlation breaks down for disturbed fluid–surface interaction by wettability manipulation. (5) Salinity dependence of proportionality factors a1 = Sm/σ″ and a2 = Spor/σ″ due to a salinity dependent partition coefficient is confirmed qualitatively. Quantitative theoretic predictions of a1 or a2 fail due to the assumption of non-reduced Stern layer mobility for clay free silica. (6) Earliest grain size related models provide the best quantitative estimate of relaxation time.

However, certain a priori knowledge of the hydraulic regime is required beforehand to avoid test failure, e.g. miss of tracer. In this study, we propose a novel tracer test concept for the hydraulic characterization of shallow unconsol-idated sedimentary deposits when only scarce a priori information on the hydraulic regime is available. Therefore, we combine conventional salt tracer testing with direct push vertical high resolution electrical conductivity logging. The proposed tracer test concept was successfully tested on coarse, braided river deposits of the Tagliamento River, Italy. With limited a priori information available two tracer tests were performed in three days to reliably determine ground water flow direction and velocity allowing on-site decision-making to adaptively install observation wells for reliable breakthrough curve measurements. Furthermore, direct push vertical electrical profiling provided essential information about the plume char-acteristics with outstanding measurement resolution and efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bignardi, S.</author><author>Mantovani, A.</author><author>Abu Zeid, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>OpenHVSR: Imaging the subsurface 2D/3D elastic properties through multiple HVSR modeling and inversion</title><secondary-title>Computers and Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers and Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>103-113</pages><volume>93</volume><keywords><keyword>2-D</keyword><keyword>3-D</keyword><keyword>HVSR</keyword><keyword>Microtremor</keyword><keyword>Soil amplification</keyword><keyword>Soil response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cageo.2016.05.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bignardi, Mantovani, Abu Zeid - 2016 - OpenHVSR Imaging the subsurface 2D3D elastic properties through multiple HVSR modeling and invers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2016.05.009</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OpenHVSR is a computer program developed in the Matlab environment, designed for the simultaneous modeling and inversion of large Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR or H/V) datasets in order to construct 2D/3D subsurface models (topography included). The program is designed to provide a high level of interactive experience to the user and still to be of intuitive use. It implements several effective and established tools already present in the code ModelHVSR by Herak (2008), and many novel features such as: -confidence evaluation on lateral heterogeneity -evaluation of frequency dependent single parameter impact on the misfit function -relaxation of Vp/Vs bounds to allow for water table inclusion -a new cost function formulation which include a slope dependent term for fast matching of peaks, which greatly enhances convergence in case of low quality HVSR curves inversion -capability for the user of editing the subsurface model at any time during the inversion and capability to test the changes before acceptance. In what follows, we shall present many features of the program and we shall show its capabilities on both simulated and real data. We aim to supply a powerful tool to the scientific and professional community capable of handling large sets of HSVR curves, to retrieve the most from their microtremor data within a reduced amount of time and allowing the experienced scientist the necessary flexibility to integrate into the model their own geological knowledge of the sites under investigation. This is especially desirable now that microtremor testing has become routinely used. After testing the code over different datasets, both simulated and real, we finally decided to make it available in an open source format. The program is available by contacting the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Longpr??-Girard, M??lanie</author><author>Martel, Richard</author><author>Robert, Thomas</author><author>Lefebvre, Ren??</author><author>Lauzon, Jean Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2D sandbox experiments of surfactant foams for mobility control and enhanced LNAPL recovery in layered soils</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Foam</keyword><keyword>LNAPL recovery</keyword><keyword>Mobility control</keyword><keyword>Sandbox</keyword><keyword>Surfactant</keyword><keyword>p-Xylene</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2016.09.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Longpr-Girard et al. - 2016 - 2D sandbox experiments of surfactant foams for mobility control and enhanced LNAPL recovery in layered soi.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The ability of surfactant foam to enhance mobility control and LNAPL recovery in a heterogeneous porous media was investigated through sandbox experiments with p-xylene used as LNAPL. A layered heterogeneous porous media was represented in a 2D sandbox filled with two layers of coarse and medium silica sand. Based on previous tests, the surfactant solution used was Ammonyx Lo at a concentration of 0.1% (w/w). The sandbox experimental program included tracer tests done under both uncontaminated and contaminated conditions, foam injection under uncontaminated conditions and surfactant solution and foam injection under contaminated conditions. Tracer tests indicated that the permeability contrast between sand layers was increased by LNAPL contamination. Foam injection under uncontaminated conditions presented a S-shaped front that indicated a better mobility control than the piston-shaped front obtained during tracer tests. During foam injection, complete sweep of the sandbox was achieved with 1.8 pore volume (PV) compared to 2.8 PV during tracer injection, thus indicating better mobility control with foam. Pre-flush of the contaminated sandbox with surfactant solution initiated p-xylene mobilization but no free phase was recovered at the effluent. A negligible p-xylene residual saturation was reached following foam injection in the contaminated sandbox. However, mass balance indicated a total recovery of only 48% of the initial p-xylene, thus indicating an underestimation of the recovery by volatilization. Recovery by volatilization was corrected, which gave the following proportions of LNAPL recovery mechanisms: 19% by mobilization, 16% by dissolution and 65% by volatilization. Results show the potential efficiency of foam remediation of LNAPL source zones in heterogeneous porous media. Still, further developments are needed prior to field scale application, which could benefit from in situ foam production that would simplify on-site operations.</abstract></record><record><database name="test export.enl" path="test export.enl">test export.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Timothy C.</author><author>Versteeg, Roelof J.</author><author>Day-Lewis, Frederick D.</author><author>Major, William</author><author>Lane, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25457440</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12291</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Johnson et al. - 2015 - Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Biostimulation is increasingly used to accelerate microbial remediation of recalcitrant groundwater contaminants. Effective application of biostimulation requires successful emplacement of amendment in the contaminant target zone. Verification of remediation performance requires postemplacement assessment and contaminant monitoring. Sampling-based approaches are expensive and provide low-density spatial and temporal information. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is an effective geophysical method for determining temporal changes in subsurface electrical conductivity. Because remedial amendments and biostimulation-related biogeochemical processes often change subsurface electrical conductivity, ERT can complement and enhance sampling-based approaches for assessing emplacement and monitoring biostimulation-based remediation. Field studies demonstrating the ability of time-lapse ERT to monitor amendment emplacement and behavior were performed during a biostimulation remediation effort conducted at the Department of Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Yard, in Brandywine, Maryland, United States. Geochemical fluid sampling was used to calibrate a petrophysical relation in order to predict groundwater indicators of amendment distribution. The petrophysical relations were field validated by comparing predictions to sequestered fluid sample results, thus demonstrating the potential of electrical geophysics for quantitative assessment of amendment-related geochemical properties. Crosshole radar zero-offset profile and borehole geophysical logging were also performed to augment the data set and validate interpretation. In addition to delineating amendment transport in the first 10 months after emplacement, the time-lapse ERT results show later changes in bulk electrical properties interpreted as mineral precipitation. Results support the use of more cost-effective surface-based ERT in conjunction with limited field sampling to improve spatial and temporal monitoring of amendment emplacement and remediation performance.</abstract></record></records></xml>
