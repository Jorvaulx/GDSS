As shown in the following, a vast amount of work has already been published on the electrical properties of soils. From this body of research, a number of significant conclusions have been made. There are important reasons behind the choice of the radio frequency range for the measurement of the electrical properties of soils to be related to engineering soil parameters and the effect of contaminants on soil. Studies of the dielectric constant of materials over the electrical frequency, radio fre-quency, and microwave frequency ranges have shown that a material may exhibit dielectric dispersion behavior in more than one of these regions, as shown in Fig. 23. A number of theories have been used to explain these dispersions (Arulan-andan and Mitchell 1967; Mitchell and Arulanandan 1968). The variation of dielectric constant and conductivity with fre-quency for clays in the electrical (low) frequency range has been interpreted as a diffusion-controlled relaxation process (Arulanandan and Mitchell 1967; Mitchell and Arulanandan 1968), based on the work of Schwarz (1962), which is depen-dent on the particle size. In the microwave frequency range, electrical dispersion has been interpreted to be caused by di-polar rotational polarization, as postulated by Debye (1929). Smith (1971) has discussed that for saturated consolidated clays, the relaxation mechanism causing electrical dispersion in the radio frequency range (1 – 100 MHz) is of the Maxwell-Wagner interfacial polarization type and is therefore a function of the composition and heterogeneity of the soil. Charges ac-cumulate at the interface between the clay particle and the surrounding solution (Quirk 1959; Olsen 1961; Quigley and Thompson 1966). In such a system, this buildup of charges takes time, and so, as the frequency is increased, there will be less time for charges to accumulate at the interface. This in turn decreases the system's ability to store electrical potential energy, thus, decreasing the dielectric constant. When the fre-quency reaches a certain value, there will not be enough time for any charges to accumulate at the interface, and at this point, the dielectric constant becomes independent of fre-quency. In the radio frequency range, the dielectric dispersion be-havior of particulate systems including various types of soils (both granular and fine-grained) has been interpreted in vari-ous papers. A three-element electrical network model based on Maxwell's equation was used to interpret the behavior of ion exchange resins (Sachs and Spiegler 1964) and clays (Arulan-andan and Smith 1973; Arulanandan et al. 1974; Smith and Arulanandan 1981). The electromagnetic theory of Maxwell-Wagner and Fricke, extended to include the mineral-solution interface characteristics, has been developed for interpreting the dielectric dispersion behavior of clay-water-electrolyte sys-a February 1997, Vol. 123, No. 2, by Abidin Kaya and Hsai-Yang Fang (Paper 12334). tems (Arulanandan 1993; Arulanandan et al. 1994). The con-clusion drawn from such studies is that the radio frequency range dielectric and conductivity dispersion behavior of soils is due to the mineral-solution interface characteristics, and, as such, this is the range in which electrical measurements can provide the most useful information on the properties of soil-water-electrolyte systems including the presence and concen-tration of contaminant. The authors have made measurements at 0.1 MHz and over the range of about 0.1 Hz to 0.1 MHz. All of these measure-ments have been made at frequencies that are too low for relating the electrical properties to the effects of pollutant and ion concentration; they are below the range over which the mechanism of dispersion is controlled by mineral-solution in-terface characteristics. Even measurements made at 13 MHz cannot be used to evaluate the soil behavior, because this fre-quency lies within the range over which clays exhibit dielectric and conductivity dispersion.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Börner, F.

Basic laboratory measurements on a variety of shaly sands, silts and clays showed that the main feature of their conductivity spectra in the frequency range from 10(-3) to 10(3) Hertz is a nearly constant phase angle. Thus, a constant-phase-angle model of electrical conductivity is applied to interpret quantitatively surface and borehole spectral induced polarization measurements. The model allows for the calculation of two independent electrical parameters from only one frequency scan and a simple separation of electrical volume and interface effects. The proposed interpretation algorithm yields the true formation factor, the cation exchange capacity and the surface-area-to-porosity ratio, which corresponds to the inverse hydraulic radius. Using a Kozeny-Carman-like equation, the estimation of hydraulic permeability is possible.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sauck, William A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A model for the resistivity structure of LNAPL plumes and their environs in sandy sediments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Contamination</keyword><keyword>Georadar</keyword><keyword>Groundwater</keyword><keyword>Hydrocarbons</keyword><keyword>Michigan</keyword><keyword>Resistivity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0926-9851(99)00021-X</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sauck - 2000 - A model for the resistivity structure of LNAPL plumes and their environs in sandy sediments.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Geophysical site characterization investigations at fuel spill sites have been generally guided by a working hypothesis which assumes that the light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) are a fully saturating phase of intrinsically very high electrical resistivity. Using observations from other related sciences, and contrary geophysical observations, a different model is developed which treats these spills as dynamic, changing systems dominated by surprisingly low resistivities. The major geophysical response of a mature or established spill of this type is due to an anomalously low resistivity zone in the lower vadose zone and upper portion of the aquifer. This zone is produced by a high total dissolved solids (TDS) leachate which is aperiodically flushed down from the volume of intimately mixed hydrocarbon, water, oxygen and soil near the base of the vadose zone where microbial activity is a maximum. This leachate is a result of acidification by organic and carbonic acids of the water-filled capillaries in the heterogeneous mixing zone at the free/residual product level, and is produced by the leaching and etching of the native mineral grains and grain coatings. This conductive inorganic plume is generally coincident with the uppermost part of the anaerobic dissolved hydrocarbon plume as defined by hydrochemical studies, but is thin and most concentrated at the top of the aquifer. It has been best detected and mapped by virtue of the amplitude shadow it causes on ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiles, and more recently by direct measurement using vertical resistivity probes (VRP) with readings every 5.08 cm from the surface to more than 7.5 m in depth. Other surface electrical geophysical methods (VES, electromagnetic method (EM), and multi-spaced horizontal resistivity profiling) can define this zone only if conditions are optimal. The conductive zone has been known for some years by hydrochemists and hydrogeologists, especially at sites where water samples are collected from short screens at multi-level wells.

However, cu~en.t methods of environmental soil characterization involve either soil sampling and analys~s f~r targeted specle~ m the labor~tory or soil electrical conductivity measurements. Soil sampling and an~~zmg m ~e laboratory mvolves the nsk of sample contamination during handling and testing. Further-more, It IS destructive. To overcome deficiencies of current identification and characterization methods the use of dielectric consta,nt an~ electric~ conductivity of the soil-fluid system has been suggested. Howeve;' little is ~now~ about the dl~l~c~c beha~lOr ~f a c~ntaminated soil-fluid system. Thus, the objective of this study is to mvesti~ate the posslb~lity of. usmg ~lelec~c constant and electrical conductivity to characterize and identify contammated fine-gramed sods. To mvestigate the usefulness of the preceding concept, the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of kaolinite, bentonite, and a local soil are determined at various ion concentrations or~anic. liquids, and mo~sture content. Results show that both dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of sod-flUid system are mamly controlled by those of pore fluid. 1994; Thevanayagam 1995a; Kaya and Fang 1996). The rea-son for using the dielectric constant is that the dielectric con-stant of soils is almost independent of chemical composition and particle shape, and is considerably lower than that of most liquids. For example, the dielectric constant of soil is between three and six, whereas that of water is about 80 in the MHz range. Both the dielectric constant and electrical conductivity measurements, among other physicochemical methods, can produce information about the subsurface properties of soils. The dielectric constant and electrical conductivity measure-ments, together, have been useful in the analysis of some char-acteristics of adsorbed pore fluids on soil particles (Calvet 1975). Also, moisture content and porosity of the soil-fluid system can be evaluated by monitoring the dielectric constant of the system. This is well documented in the soil science literature. However, little is known about the dielectric behav-ior of noncontaminated and contaminated fine-grained soil-fluid systems. The complexity of the fine-grained soils arises because of the polarization of the diffuse double layer whereas coarse grained soils do not possess polarization at which most of the studies have been conducted. For example, among oth-ers, Selig and Mansukhani (1975), Arulanandan (1991), and Thevanayagam (1993). The differences in polarization can be attributed to the surface activity of soils. For example, to es-tablish an analytical method to determine the dielectric con-stant of a soil-fluid system, Thevanayagam (1995) presented an analytical model that works relatively well for coarse-grained soils. However, to obtain meaningful results for fine-grained soils, he had to use a dielectric constant of 10 for kaolinite and 40 for bentonite, although both soils have di-electric constants of approximately four. Thus, it is the aim of this paper to investigate the behavior of the dielectric constant and the electrical conductivity of noncontaminated and con-taminated fine-grained soils.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knight, Rosemary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GROUND PENETRATING RADAR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS</title><secondary-title>Annu.

In applications in contaminant hydrology, radar data can be used to detect the presence of liquid organic contaminants, many of which have dielectric properties distinctly different from those of the other solid and fluid components in the subsurface. The resolution (approximately meter-scale) of the radar imaging method is such that it can also be used in the development of hydrogeologic models of the subsurface, required to predict the fate and transport of contaminants. GPR images are interpreted to obtain models of the large-scale architecture of the subsurface and to assist in estimating hydrogeologic properties such as water content, porosity, and permeability. Its noninvasive capabilities make GPR an attractive alternative to the traditional methods used for subsurface characterization.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vanhala, Heikki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping oil-contaminated sand and till with the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Prospecting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Prospecting</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><isbn>0016-8025</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2478.1997.00338.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Vanhala - 1997 - Mapping oil-contaminated sand and till with the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The laboratory and field results from an environmental application of the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method are presented. The phase spectra of the resistivity of uncontaminated glacial till, silt sand and gravel were measured in the laboratory. The effects of waste oil and motor oil on the phase and amplitude spectra of the resistivity were studied using artificially contaminated sand and till samples and mineral soil samples from real waste sites. Field IP and SIP measurements were also made at the waste sites. The laboratory phase spectra of sands and tills were straight or slightly concave upwards in a log-log plot. The phase angle varies between 0.1 and 20 mrad at 1 Hz frequency and increases towards higher frequencies with a slope of 0.15-0.25. In laboratory tests, motor oil and waste oil changed the phase and amplitude spectra of sand and till. At first, the amplitude and phase decreased due to oil contamination. Later, during continued maturation, both the amplitude and phase increased. After a few days or weeks of maturation, some of the contaminated samples showed a convex-upwards phase spectrum. The features observed in artificially contaminated samples were also detected in the sample material from real waste sites. Furthermore, the in situ results from the waste sites were in agreement with the laboratory results. In laboratory tests, the phase spectra of clean sand and till remained stable with time, whereas the phase spectra of oil-contaminated samples changed with increasing maturation time. This, together with the field results, suggests that differences between the spectra of clean and polluted soils, and also changes occurring in the phase spectra of contaminated soils with time, can be indicative of contamination.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Osiensky, James L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ground water modeling of mise-a-la-masse delineation of contaminated ground water plumes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0022-1694(96)03279-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Osiensky - 1997 - Ground water modeling of mise-a-la-masse delineation of contaminated ground water plumes.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Finite-difference simulations of mise-a-la-masse electrical flow through conductive contaminant plumes show that the approximate dimensions of a plume and the approximate location of its center of mass can be derived from the resulting electrical potential fields. Contaminant plumes that exhibit 'Gaussian' (statistically normal) concentration distributions form trending heterogeneities with respect to electrical conductivity. These plumes are relatively poor conductors with electrical conductivity decreasing continuously with distance outward from the contaminant source in the directions of plume migration. Thus, electrical flow from a single, current electrode placed in the source of a contaminant plume refracts continuously with distance from the source as the current flows preferentially through the plume. Changes in the electrical potential field that occur at the land surface due to the presence of an evolving plume can be used to monitor the growth of the plume.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McMahon, Peter B.</author><author>Vroblesky, Don A.</author><author>Bradley, Paul M.</author><author>Chapelle, Francis H.</author><author>Gullett, Cheryl D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for Enhanced Mineral Dissolution in Organic Acid‐Rich Shallow Ground Water</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1995</year></dates><isbn>0017-467X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1745-6584.1995.tb00275.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://McMahon et al. - 1995 - Evidence for Enhanced Mineral Dissolution in Organic Acid‐Rich Shallow Ground Water.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Total concentrations of formate, acetate, and isobutyrate varied from less than 5 to greater than 9,000 mu mol/l over distances of &lt;3 m in ground water from a shallow hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer. Laboratory incubations of aquifer material indicate that organic acid concentrations were dependent on the amount of hydrocarbon loading in the sediment and the relative rates of microbial organic acid production and consumption. In heavily contaminated sediments, production greatly exceeded consumption and organic acid concentrations increased. In lightly contaminated sediments rates were essentially equal and organic acid concentrations remained low, Concentrations of dissolved calcium, magnesium, and iron generally were one to two orders of magnitude higher in organic acid-rich ground water than in ground water having low organic acid concentrations. Carbonate and Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide minerals were the likely sources of these elements. Similarly, concentrations of dissolved silica, derived from quartz and k- feldspar, were higher in organic acid-rich ground water than in other waters, The positive relation (r = 0.60, p&lt;.05, n = 16) between concentrations of silica and organic acids suggests that the microbially mediated buildup of organic acids in ground water enhanced quartz/k-feldspar dissolution in the aquifer, although it was not the only factor influencing their dissolution. A model that included organic acid microequivalents normalized by cation microequivalents significantly strengthened the correlation (r = 0.79, p&lt;.001, n = 16) between dissolved silica and organic acid concentrations, indicating that competition between silica and cations for complexation sites on organic acids also influenced quartz/k- feldspar dissolution. Physical evidence for enhanced mineral dissolution in organic acid-rich waters included scanning electron microscopy images of highly corroded quartz and k- feldspar grains from portions of the aquifer containing organic acid-rich ground water. Microporosity generated in hydrocarbon contaminated sediments may adversely affect remediation efforts that depend on the efficient injection of electron accepters into an aquifer or on the recovery of solutes from an aquifer.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sevil, Jorge</author><author>Gutiérrez, Francisco</author><author>Zarroca, Mario</author><author>Desir, Gloria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sinkhole investigation in an urban area by trenching in combination with GPR, ERT and high-precision leveling.

The complex heterogeneity of fractured rock poses enormous challenges to groundwater remediation professionals, and new methods are needed to cost-effectively infer fracture and fracture-zone locations, orientations and properties, and to develop conceptual site models for flow and transport. Despite the potential of geophysical methods to &quot; see &quot; between boreholes, two issues have impeded the adoption of geophysical methods by remediation professionals. First, geophysical results are commonly only indirectly related to the properties of interest (e.g., permeability) to remediation pro-fessionals, and qualitative or quantitative interpretation is required to convert geophysical results to hydrogeologic information. Additional demonstration/evaluation projects are needed in the site reme-diation literature to fully transfer geophysical methods from research to practice. Second, geophysical methods are commonly viewed as inherently risky by remediation professionals. Although it is widely understood that a given method may or may not work at a particular site, the reasons are not always clear to end users of geophysical products. Synthetic modeling tools are used in research to assess the potential of a particular method to successfully image a target, but these tools are not widely used in industry. Here, we seek to advance the application of geophysical methods to solve problems facing remediation professionals with respect to fractured-rock aquifers. To this end, we (1) provide an over-view of geophysical methods applied to characterization and monitoring of fractured-rock aquifers; (2) review case studies showcasing different geophysical methods; and (3) discuss best practices for method selection and rejection based on synthetic modeling and decision support tools.

Whether it is the onshore extraction of oil and gas, the subsurface injection of waters for geothermal power or the deep storage of waste products, communities across the world are being confronted with controversial geological interventions be-neath their backyards. Communicating these complex scientific and technical issues is made more challenging by the general public's unfamiliarity with the geological realm. Cognitive studies confirm a cultural dissonance with the subsurface and highlight lay anxieties about tampering with nature. In addressing those concerns, factual information is argued to be subordinate to values and beliefs in shaping public perspectives on contested geoscientific issues. In this context, scientists' attention to technical accuracy and their emphasis on professional consensus may do little to influence multiple publics whose worries instead root into their sense of place, trust and governance, as well as equity and ethics. With a growing recognition that it is social rather than technical factors that stir public unease and fuel community outrage, geoscientists need to develop new strategies to engage dissonant publics, underpinned by a culture change in geocommunication from conveying 'matters of fact' to brokering 'matters of concern'.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crook, N.</author><author>Rucker, D.F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Waterborne Electrical Resistivity of the Hypersaline Mono Lake</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>A short, waterborne streamer resistivity survey was conducted on Mono Lake in California. The lake, located on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, contains a significant amount of dissolved solids due to being a terminal lake with no outlet. The survey was conducted to determine if the method could be used to define subbottom sediments and other geological features to answer questions related to recent-past volcanic and tectonic events. The survey used a 15-meter dipole-dipole array towed at approximately 2 mph behind a small flat bottomed boat. The survey was limited in scope to collecting approximately 6,000 m of data within the western cove, where substantial core sampling has taken place. Comparison of the methods indicates the towed array can obtain good quality data despite the lake's conductivity being in excess of 84,000 uS/cm. The resistivity models reconstructed geological material upwards of 400 ohm-m to depths of 35 m, which likely represent hard rock below the lake. We conclude that the method could be used to map most of the shallow areas of the lake, where the water column is less than 20 m. The deepest areas of the lake, south of Paoha Island, would require streamer resistivity cables with an electrode spacing of at least 60 m..</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Byrdina, S.</author><author>Revil, A.</author><author>Gunawan, H.</author><author>Saing, U.B.</author><author>Grandis, H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrothermal system of the Papandayan Volcano from temperature, self-potential (SP) and geochemical measurements</title><secondary-title>AIP Conference Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIP Conference Proceedings</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>© 2017 Author(s). Papandayan volcano in West Java, Indonesia, is characterized by intense hydrothermal activities manifested by numerous fumaroles at three craters or kawah, i.e. Mas, Manuk and Baru. The latter was created after November 2002 phreatic eruption. Since 2011, numerous volcano-tectonic B events are encountered and the volcano was set on alert status on several occasions. The purpose of the present study is to delineate the structure of the summital hydrothermal system from Self-Potential (SP), soil temperature and gas concentrations in the soil (CO 2 , SO 2  and H 2 S) data. This combination of geophysical and geochemical methods allows identification of the weak permeable zones serving as preferential pathways for hydrothermal circulation and potential candidates to future landslides or flank collapses. This study is an on-going collaborative research project and we plan to conduct electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and also Induced-Polarization (IP) surveys. Additional data would allow the 3D imaging of the studied area. The IP parameters will be used to characterise and to quantify the degree of alteration of the volcanic rocks as has been shown very recently in the laboratory studies. There are also rocks and soil samples that will undergo laboratory analyses at ISTerre for IP and complex resistivity parameters at the sample scale that will help to interpret the survey results.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Angelis, D.</author><author>Tsourlos, P.</author><author>Tsokas, G.</author><author>Vargemezis, G.</author><author>Zacharopoulou, G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accessing a historic wall structure using GPR. the case of Heptapyrgion fortress Thessaloniki Greece</title><secondary-title>2017 9th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar, IWAGPR 2017 - Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2017 9th International Workshop on Advanced Ground Penetrating Radar, IWAGPR 2017 - Proceedings</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>© 2017 IEEE. In this work we study part of the Northern wall structure of the Heptapyrgion fortress of Thessaloniki (UNESCO monument) that was identified to face moisture and structural problems. Moisture damage is a critical issue in the preservation and integrity of historic walls, thus it is necessary to detect it and to develop restoration plans. Heptapyrgion is one of the most important monuments in Thessaloniki so it is very crucial to use non-destructive techniques. To achieve that, a pilot GPR survey was conducted. The data obtained with 250 and 500MHz antennas were processed and interpreted in relation to the existing problem. To further assist the interpretation 2D GPR model simulations were carried out. GPR data was also compared to geoelectrical ERT data obtained at the same section on the wall. Overall GPR images are in good agreement with existing information and proved very useful in accessing the wall structure.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bücker, M.</author><author>Orozco, A.F.</author><author>García, S.L.</author><author>Guerrero, B.O.</author><author>Pérez, L.</author><author>Caballero, M.</author><author>Caballero, L.</author><author>de la Paz, C.P.</author><author>Sánchez-Galindo, A.</author><author>Villegas, F.J.</author><author>Brown, E.</author><author>Werne, J.</author><author>Garcés, B.V.</author><author>Schwalb, A.</author><author>Kemna, A.</author><author>Sánchez-Alvaro, E.</author><author>Launizar-Martínez, N.</author><author>Valverde-Placencia, A.</author><author>Garay-Jiménez, F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geoelectrical and electromagnetic methods applied to paleolimnological studies: Two examples from desiccated lakes in the Basin of Mexico</title><secondary-title>Boletin de la Sociedad Geologica Mexicana</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Boletin de la Sociedad Geologica Mexicana</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>Paleolimnological studies require a broad understanding of the geometry and depth of the sedimentary fill of lake basins prior to coring campaigns. Seismic methods are routinely employed for the indirect characterization of lake-bottom sediments. However, the use of seismic methods might occasionally be limited due to surface conditions or poor seismic contrasts between the stratigraphic units, which lead to data quality that is too poor to provide sufficient information for the selection of drill sites. Sources of cultural noise are one of the main reasons why seismic methods fail in study areas near or within large cities, such as Mexico City. Under certain conditions, electrical and electromagnetic methods might be a suitable substitute or complement to seismic exploration, as they respond to different physical properties of the subsurface. To evaluate the applicability of such methods, here we present two recent case studies from the desiccated lakes Chalco and Xochimilco both located in urban areas within the Basin of Mexico where electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), transient electromagnetic (TEM) and magnetotelluric (MT) soundings were conducted for the characterization of lake basement and lacustrine sediments. In both examples, the results of the geophysical exploration contributed valuable stratigraphic information for the following drilling and core recovery, which highlights the potential of electrical and electromagnetic methods in paleolimnological studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kolawole, F.</author><author>Atekwana, E.A.</author><author>Abdelsalam, M.G.</author><author>Malloy, S.</author><author>Stamps, D.S.</author><author>Grandin, R.</author><author>Leseane, K.</author><author>Shemang, E.M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aeromagnetic, gravity, and Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar analyses reveal the causative fault of the 3 April 2017 M&lt;inf&gt;w&lt;/inf&gt; 6.5 Moiyabana, Botswana, earthquake</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>©2017.

On 3 April 2017, a M w  6.5 earthquake struck Moiyabana, Botswana, nucleating at  &gt; 20 km focal depth within the Paleoproterozoic Limpopo-Shashe orogenic belt separating the Archean Zimbabwe and Kaapvaal Cratons. We investigate the lithospheric structures associated with this earthquake using high-resolution aeromagnetic and gravity data integrated with Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) analysis. Here we present the first results that provide insights into the tectonic framework of the earthquake. The ruptured fault trace delineated by DInSAR aligns with a distinct NW striking and NE dipping magnetic lineament within the Precambrian basement. The fault plane solution and numerical modeling indicate that the cause of the earthquake was 1.8 m displacement along a NW striking and NE dipping normal fault, rupturing at 21-24 km depth. We suggest that this seismic event was due to extensional reactivation of a crustal-scale Precambrian thrust splay within the Limpopo-Shashe orogenic belt.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kazakis, N.</author><author>Pavlou, A.</author><author>Vargemezis, G.</author><author>Voudouris, K.

Hydrochemical data and geoelectrical measurements were combined and supplemented to determine the hydrochemical regime of the study site in regard to seawater phenomena. Chemical analysis of groundwater was performed in 126 boreholes and fifteen electrical resistivity tomographies (ERT) were measured, whereas in two sites the ERT measurements were repeated following the wet season. The Cl- concentrations recorded reached 2240mg/L indicating seawater intrusion which was also verified by ionic ratios. The ionic ratios were overlapped and a seawater intrusion map (SWIM) was produced. A significant part of the coastal aquifer (up to 150km2) is influenced by seawater intrusion. The areas with the most intensive salinization are located between Nea Kallikratia-Epanomi and Aggelochori-Peraia. According to the ERTs, in the influenced areas the salinization of the aquifer exceeds 1km toward the mainland and its depth reaches 200m. In the area surrounding Thessaloniki airport, the ERTs revealed salinization of the upper aquifer to depths of up to 40m, whereas the lower aquifer is uninfluenced. This abnormal distribution of seawater intrusion demonstrates the value of geoelectrical methods in the study of seawater intrusion especially in areas with limited available hydrochemical data.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ravindran, A.

It has been established that the groundwaters in the coastal zone of the Zirconium Complex, Pazhayakayal, Thoothukudi district, Tamilnadu, India, are subjected to wave and tidal impact. The groundwater quality was studied by hydrogeological methods, 2D electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) techniques (six profiles), 11 Wenner vertical electrical sounding (VES), and well log analysis. Also, nine geochemical water samples were taken from the study area. The 2D ERI and VES surveys were carried out using WGMD-4 Ltd., Chennai, resistivity meter, multicore cable, and multielectrodes with Wenner array. The collected resistivity data were interpreted using the Res2DINV software. The research shows that the groundwaters are the result of the paleoriver flow along the Tamirabarani Channel in the western area and of the seawater intrusion in the eastern area. The fresh water is characterized by resistivity of about 10-100 Ohm{dot operator}m in the study area. The resistivity of 10-50 Ohm{dot operator}m indicates that the subsurface section is made up of sand, clay, and caliche. Resistivity values of more than 200 Ohm{dot operator}m are specific to sand dunes. The very low resistivity (&lt;5 Ohm{dot operator}m) layer might be due to the seawater intrusion in the study area. Six water samples from the well drilled in the coastal area were analyzed, which made it possible to determine the concentrations of major and trace elements in the groundwaters. These data were used to establish the seawater intrusion and coastal environment characteristics in the study area. ?? 2013.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, J.

Both the classification scheme and statistical analysis are undertaken at Water Framework Directive surface water body scale for England and Wales, in baseflow conditions when relative groundwater contribution to rivers is greatest. The results of multiple regression analyses demonstrate statistically significant relationships between the classification of natural attenuation potential, its component properties, and baseflow river nitrate concentration. Natural attenuation at the groundwater-surface water interface is shown to be a significant control on observed river nitrate concentrations, albeit less influential than land-use descriptors. The results indicate that natural attenuation processes have a measurable impact on baseflow river chemistry at surface water body scale, and that consideration of natural attenuation processes at the groundwater-surface water interface would improve regional and catchment-scale risk prediction, and could help in the design of more sustainable catchment management strategies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Characterizing and quantifying this influence is critical for successful management of water resources in many catchments, particularly those threatened by rising nitrate levels in groundwater. Building on previous experimental investigations in one such catchment: the River Leith, UK, we report on a multimeasurement, multiscale program aimed at developing a conceptualization of groundwater-surface water flow pathways along a 200 m reach. Key to this conceptualization is the quantification of vertical and horizontal water fluxes, which is achieved through a series of Darcian flow estimates coupled with in-stream piezometer tracer dilution tests. These data, enhanced by multilevel measurements of chloride concentration in riverbed pore water and water-borne geophysical surveying, reveal a contrast in the contribution of flow components along the reach. In the upper section of the reach, a localized connectivity to regional groundwater, that appears to suppress the hyporheic zone, is identified. Further downstream, horizontal (lateral and longitudinal) flows appear to contribute more to the total subsurface flow at the groundwater-surface water interface. Although variation in hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed is observed, localized variation that can account for the spatial variability in flow pathways is not evident. The study provides a hydrological conceptualization for the site, which is essential for future studies which address biogeochemical processes, in relation to nitrogen retention/release. Such a conceptualization would not have been possible without a multiexperimental program.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arora, T.</author><author>Linde, N.</author><author>Revil, A.</author><author>Castermant, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Non-intrusive characterization of the redox potential of landfill leachate plumes from self-potential data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Contaminant plume</keyword><keyword>Geobattery</keyword><keyword>Hydraulic head</keyword><keyword>Redox potential</keyword><keyword>Self-potential</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0169-7722</isbn><accession-num>17395333</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2007.01.018</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Contaminant plumes (e.g., associated with leakages from municipal landfills) provide a source of natural electrical potentials (or &quot;self-potentials&quot;) recordable at the Earth's surface. One contribution to these self-potentials is associated with pore water flow (i.e., the &quot;streaming potential&quot;), and the other is related to redox conditions. A contaminant plume can be regarded as a &quot;geobattery&quot;: the source current potentially results from the degradation of the organic matter by micro-organisms, which produces electrons. These electrons are then carried by nanowires that connect bacteria and thorough metallic particles that precipitate in areas of strong redox potential gradient. In the case of the Entressen landfill (South of France), reported here, the hydraulic head differences measured in piezometers outside the contaminant plume is strongly linked to the surface self-potential signals, with a correlation coefficient of - 0.94. We used a Bayesian method that combines hydraulic head and self-potential data collected outside the contaminated area to estimate the streaming potential component of the collected self-potential data. Once the streaming potential contribution was removed from the measured self-potentials, the correlation coefficient between the residual self-potentials and the measured redox potentials in the aquifer was 0.92. The slope of this regression curve was close to 0.5, which was fairly consistent with both finite element modelling and the proposed geobattery model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Various geophysical methods can be employed for this purpose but not all of them can provide an unambiguous localization of this type of target. We propose a combined inversion of self-potential and resistivity data and the use of joint attributes (characterizing the target) to localize the burning front of a coal seam fire. This new methodology is applied to the 3D reconstruction of a shallow coal seam fire in Boulder, Colorado. The coal seam fire is located in the Gorham subbituminous coal formation at a depth comprised between 10 and 15. m. The self-potential survey comprises 160 stations (5 profiles and 32 stations per profile) located at the ground surface with self-potential anomalies amounting + 70 to - 50. mV with respect to an arbitrary reference located further away from the burning front. The resistivity survey comprises 5 resistivity profiles with 118 measurements per profile (590 measurements in total). The burning front is associated with very low value of the electrical resistivity (&lt; 15. Ω. m) and source current density probably of thermoelectric nature. The combined inversion and interpretation of the self-potential and resistivity data indicates clearly the position of the coal seam fire, which is corroborated by a thermal anomaly observed at depth of 30. cm and indicating that the minimum depth of the thermal source is approximately 9. m. This methodology can be easily extended to greater depths using resistivity derived from galvanometric or airborne electromagnetic methods and large-scale self-potential surveys. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Revil, A.</author><author>Ahmed, A.S.</author><author>Jardani, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Self-potential: A Non-intrusive Ground Water Flow Sensor</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>The flow of the ground water in an aquifer or during pumping test generates an electrical current (called the streaming current), which is of advective nature. The resulting electrical field (streaming potential field, one of the components of the self-potential field) can be remotely measured at the ground surface or in boreholes. We first discuss the underlying physics of this electrokinetic effect and the role of the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains. We show how the drag of the excess of electrical charge of the pore water by the flow is equivalent to a source current density. Then, we discuss the metrological aspects, the type of voltmeter and electrodes required to carry out good measurements in field conditions. Two applications are discussed in steady-state conditions. The first is dedicated to the flow of water in shallow aquifers. In this case, the streaming current and the conduction current are nearly balanced and, inside the aquifer, the electrical equipotentials mimic the hydraulic equipotentials. They have, however, the advantage to extend the shape of these hydraulic equipotentials up to the ground surface. The second case is related to the flow of water in the vadose zone, here again investigated in steady-state conditions. In this situation, the vadose zone is polarized and the ground surface electrical potential map reflects essentially the depth of the vadose zone. A case study is shown for a small watershed in the South of France. The resistivity tomography shows no contrast in resistivity between the vadose zone and the aquifer and the observed self-potential data are observed to be linearly correlated to the depth of the water table..</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebrahimzadeh, M.</author><author>Gerhard, J.I.</author><author>Tsourlos, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Self-potential for monitoring soil remediation by smouldering: A proof of concept</title><secondary-title>Near Surface Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Near Surface Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><urls/><abstract>© 2017 European Association of Geoscientists  &amp;  Engineers. Near-surface soils contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquids, such as coal tar, crude oil, and chlorinated solvents, remain a serious problem. Smouldering remediation is a technique now being applied in the field for in situ destruction of non-aqueous phase liquids. Based on a selfsustaining exothermic reaction, smouldering remediation generates a hot region ( &gt; 400 °C) that propagates through the subsurface. Self-potential is here considered for the first time as a nondestructive means for monitoring the smouldering remediation process. First, a series of sandbox experiments were conducted to investigate the magnitude of the thermoelectric coupling coefficient (CTE) for different sand sizes, water contents, and heat sources. Measured CTE values ranged from -0.47 mV/°C for coarse, water-saturated sand to -0.05 mV/°C for fine sand with a saturation of 30%. Next, self-potential measurements were conducted during several laboratory smouldering remediation experiments, examining the response as a function of both space and time. A significant self-potential anomaly was observed on the surface during the smouldering period. Moreover, the magnitude of the self-potential anomaly was demonstrated to be highly correlated to the separation distance between the (moving) reaction front and the (stationary) self-potential electrode positions. Overall, this research suggests that the self-potential method has a significant promise as a non-invasive monitoring tool for in situ smouldering remediation of contaminated sites.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mewafy, Farag M.</author><author>Atekwana, Estella A.</author><author>Werkema, D.

A contaminated and an uncontaminated core were retrieved from a site contaminated with crude oil near Bemidji, Minnesota and subsampled for MS measurements. The contaminated core revealed enriched MS zones within the hydrocarbon smear zone, which is related to iron-reduction coupled to oxidation of hydrocarbon compounds and the vadose zone, which is coincident with a zone of methane depletion suggesting aerobic or anaerobic oxidation of methane is coupled to iron-reduction. The latter has significant implications for methane cycling.

This patchiness drives intricate hyporheic flux patterns that govern the exchange of O-2 and redox-sensitive solutes between the water column and the stream bed. We used multiple tracer techniques, naturally occurring and injected, to evaluate hyporheic flow dynamics and associated biogeochemical cycling and microbial reactivity around 2 beaver dams in Wyoming (USA). High-resolution fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing was used to collect temperature data over 9 vertical streambed profiles and to generate comprehensive vertical flux maps using 1-dimensional (1-D) heat-transport modeling. Coincident with these locations, vertical profiles of hyporheic water were collected every week and analyzed for dissolved O2, pH, dissolved organic C, and several conservative and redox-sensitive solutes. In addition, hyporheic and net stream aerobic microbial reactivity were analyzed with a constant-rate injection of the biologically sensitive resazurin (Raz) smart tracer. The combined results revealed a heterogeneous system with rates of downwelling hyporheic flow organized by morphologic unit and tightly coupled to the redox conditions of the subsurface. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variability of all redox-sensitive species, and results indicated that hyporheic water varied from oxic-stream-like to anoxic-reduced in direct response to the hydrodynamic conditions and associated residence times. The anaerobic transition threshold predicted by the mean O-2 Damko &quot;hler number seemed to overestimate the actual transition as indicated by multiple secondary electron acceptors, illustrating the gradient nature of anaerobic transition. Temporal flux variability in low-flux morphologies generated a much greater range in hyporheic redox conditions compared to high-flux zones, and chemical responses to changing flux rates were consistent with those predicted from the empirical relationship between redox condition and residence time. The Raz tracer revealed that hyporheic flow paths have strong net aerobic respiration, particularly at higher residence time, but this reactive exchange did not affect the net stream signal at the reach scale.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hare, Danielle K.</author><author>Briggs, Martin A.</author><author>Rosenberry, Donald O.</author><author>Boutt, David F.</author><author>Lane, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of thermal infrared to fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing for evaluation of groundwater discharge to surface water</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Distributed temperature sensing</keyword><keyword>Groundwater seepage</keyword><keyword>Groundwater/surface water interactions</keyword><keyword>Heat tracing</keyword><keyword>Infrared</keyword><keyword>Streams</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.059</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Groundwater has a predictable thermal signature that can be used to locate discrete zones of discharge to surface water. As climate warms, surface water with strong groundwater influence will provide habitat stability and refuge for thermally stressed aquatic species, and is therefore critical to locate and protect. Alternatively, these discrete seepage locations may serve as potential point sources of contaminants from polluted aquifers. This study compares two increasingly common heat tracing methods to locate discrete groundwater discharge: direct-contact measurements made with fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) and remote sensing measurements collected with thermal infrared (TIR) cameras. FO-DTS is used to make high spatial resolution (typically m) thermal measurements through time within the water column using temperature-sensitive cables. The spatial-temporal data can be analyzed with statistical measures to reveal zones of groundwater influence, however, the personnel requirements, time to install, and time to georeference the cables can be burdensome, and the control units need constant calibration. In contrast, TIR data collection, either from handheld, airborne, or satellite platforms, can quickly capture point-in-time evaluations of groundwater seepage zones across large scales. However the remote nature of TIR measurements means they can be adversely influenced by a number of environmental and physical factors, and the measurements are limited to the surface &quot;skin&quot; temperature of water features. We present case studies from a range of lentic to lotic aquatic systems to identify capabilities and limitations of both technologies and highlight situations in which one or the other might be a better instrument choice for locating groundwater discharge. FO-DTS performs well in all systems across seasons, but data collection was limited spatially by practical considerations of cable installation. TIR is found to consistently locate groundwater seepage zones above and along the streambank, but submerged seepage zones are only well identified in shallow systems (e.g. &lt;0.5 m depth) with moderate flow. Winter data collection, when groundwater is relatively warm and buoyant, increases the water surface expression of discharge zones in shallow systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal

In this study, we tested the ability of geophysical methods to characterize a large technical landfill installed in a former sand quarry. The geophysical surveys specifically aimed at delimitating the deposit site horizontal extension, at estimating its thickness and at characterizing the waste material composition (the moisture content in the present case). The site delimitation was conducted with electromagnetic (in-phase and out-of-phase) and magnetic (vertical gradient and total field) methods that clearly showed the transition between the waste deposit and the host formation. Regarding waste deposit thickness evaluation, electrical resistivity tomography appeared inefficient on this particularly thick deposit site. Thus, we propose a combination of horizontal to vertical noise spectral ratio (HVNSR) and multichannel analysis of the surface waves (MASW), which successfully determined the approximate waste deposit thickness in our test landfill. However, ERT appeared to be an appropriate tool to characterize the moisture content of the waste, which is of prior information for the organic waste biodegradation process. The global multi-scale and multi-method geophysical survey offers precious information for site rehabilitation studies, water content mitigation processes for enhanced biodegradation or landfill mining operation planning.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McLachlan, P.J.</author><author>Chambers, J.E.</author><author>Uhlemann, S.S.</author><author>Binley, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical characterisation of the groundwater-surface water interface</title><secondary-title>Advances in Water Resources</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Water Resources</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.09.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://McLachlan et al. - 2017 - Geophysical characterisation of the groundwater-surface water interface.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cardarelli, Ettore</author><author>De Donno, Giorgio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multidimensional electrical resistivity survey for bedrock detection at the Rieti Plain (Central Italy)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>77-87</pages><volume>141</volume><issue>Supplement C</issue><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Inversion</keyword><keyword>Model appraisal</keyword><keyword>Rieti Plain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.04.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306152</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The combined use of 1D, 2D and 3D electrical resistivity methods for estimating bedrock depth is presented with an application to a case study located in Central Italy. The site is a narrow basin where two boreholes were drilled reaching the bedrock, which had the greatest depth in the center of the basin. Six vertical electrical soundings were executed along a basin cross-section in order to have a preliminary 1D reconstruction of the bedrock and the overlying alluvial deposits. Inverted resistivity models, show bedrock depths in accordance with the borehole data and a complex subsurface layering of the overburden deposits to be further investigated with 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography. Four additional electrical lines, acquired using a pole-dipole array and directed normally to the alignment of the vertical soundings, confirm the 1D results in regards to the bedrock depths, adding additional information about the continuity of the bedrock within the basin, and giving a high resolution image of the shallower sediments. Through the tomographic inversion of 3D data we were able to reconstruct a volumetric image of the carbonate formation at the study site. Finally, the tomographic models have been validated through the inversion of a synthetic dataset, with the aim to attain a final model, whose synthetic model is comparable with the field one. The final model, estimated using an iterative procedure that minimises the absolute difference between field and synthetic models, has retrieved a bedrock resistivity one order of magnitude higher than that obtained from field data inversion.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Newspaper Article">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cillis, Donato</author><author>Pezzuolo, Andrea</author><author>Marinello, Francesco</author><author>Sartori, Luigi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Field-scale electrical resistivity profiling mapping for delineating soil condition in a nitrate vulnerable zone</title><secondary-title>Applied Soil Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Soil Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>-</pages><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity mapping</keyword><keyword>Productive potential</keyword><keyword>Site-specific management</keyword><keyword>Soil condition</keyword><keyword>Spatial variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.06.025</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139317301300</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Venice Lagoon is an extremely heterogeneous environment conditioned by natural changes and anthropogenic pressures. The area is a particularly vulnerable system characterized by high spatial geomorphological variability. Site-specific crop management, defined as the best strategies to manage heterogeneous farmlands, has the potential to maximize agricultural production while preserving soil and water resources. This work was aimed at identifying and characterizing spatial variability within the fields in terms of soil fertility and productive potential using precision agriculture principles. Automatic resistivity profiling (ARP) was implemented to study spatial variability of the field and to define the best localization of twenty soil sampling points. Three years' historical yield maps were used to determine homogeneous zones within the study area. The application of a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm led to classification of four homogeneous zones, which were assigned with productive potentials using an ANOVA test of soil features and historical yield data. Such classification was validated by a comparison of the homogeneous zone's productive potential with five-year average production.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butchibabu, B</author><author>Sandeep, N</author><author>Sivaram, Y V</author><author>Jha, P C</author><author>Khan, P K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bridge pier foundation evaluation using cross-hole seismic tomographic imaging</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>104-114</pages><volume>144</volume><keywords><keyword>Cross-hole seismic tomography</keyword><keyword>Foundation evaluation</keyword><keyword>Joints</keyword><keyword>Rock-mass quality (Q)</keyword><keyword>Shear zones</keyword><keyword>Weak zones</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.07.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092698511730263X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
An ambitious project connecting Jammu and Srinagar through a railway link in tectonically active and geologically complex Himalayan Mountain terrain is under progress. Under this project, the world's highest (359 m) railway arch-bridge is under construction across the River Chenab in the northern territory of India. This mega engineering structure has a two-fold ribbed arch design, comprising of steel girders. During the excavation for one of the concrete pillars on the right abutment, wide open joints and weak/shear zones were noticed. The width of these joints varies from 30 to 50 cm, trending along N170° with a dip of 65°. The foundation area of this pillar is 13 m × 24 m and on the cut slopes of the right bank of Chenab River. These exposed joints and weak zones were treated with consolidation grouting to strengthen the foundation area. To delineate the extent of these joints and weak zones below the foundation level, seismic tomography was carried out in five boreholes drilled for this purpose to cover the 300 sq-m area. The results of cross-hole seismic tomography reveals the presence of three low velocity (≤ 2600 m/s) anomalous zones below the foundation area. This also ascertained the efficacy of grouting in consolidating the joints and weak zones. Later, rock-mass quality (Q) was determined based on the relationship between the P-wave velocity and the Q-value (Barton, 2002) to infer the support system for the slope stabilization below the foundation. 3-D visualization of the seismic velocity demarcates the extent of weak or untreated zones. This methodology facilitates to update the design parameters according to Q-values during the construction stage and estimate the required level of reinforcement and support system.

One of the current testing procedures to select backfill material for construction of MSE walls is the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials standard T 288: “Standard Method of Test for Determining Minimum Laboratory Soil Resistivity.” T 288 is designed to test a soil sample's electrical resistivity which correlates to its corrosive potential. The test is run on soil material passing the No. 10 sieve and believed to be inappropriate for coarse aggregate. Therefore, researchers have proposed new methods to measure the electrical resistivity of coarse aggregate samples in the laboratory. There is a need to verify that the proposed methods yield results representative of the in situ conditions; however, no in situ measurement of the electrical resistivity of MSE wall backfill is established. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) provides a two-dimensional (2D) profile of the bulk resistivity of backfill material in situ. The objective of this study was to characterize bulk resistivity of in-place MSE wall backfill aggregate using ERT.

Five MSE walls were tested via ERT to determine the bulk resistivity of the backfill. Three of the walls were reinforced with polymeric geogrid, one wall was reinforced with metallic strips, and one wall was a gravity retaining wall with no reinforcement. Variability of the measured resistivity distribution within the backfill may be a result of non-uniform particle sizes, thoroughness of compaction, and the presence of water. A quantitative post processing algorithm was developed to calculate mean bulk resistivity of in-situ backfill. Recommendations of the study were that the ERT data be used to verify proposed testing methods for coarse aggregate that are designed to yield data representative of in situ conditions. A preliminary analysis suggests that ERT may be utilized as construction quality assurance for thoroughness of compaction in MSE construction; however more data are needed at this time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steelman, Colby M</author><author>Klazinga, Dylan R</author><author>Cahill, Aaron G</author><author>Endres, Anthony L</author><author>Parker, Beth L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring the evolution and migration of a methane gas plume in an unconfined sandy aquifer using time-lapse GPR and ERT</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>12-24</pages><volume>205</volume><issue>Supplement C</issue><keywords><keyword>Borden aquifer</keyword><keyword>ERT</keyword><keyword>Fugitive methane</keyword><keyword>GPR</keyword><keyword>Groundwater contamination</keyword><keyword>Stray gas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.08.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169772217300360</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Fugitive methane (CH4) leakage associated with conventional and unconventional petroleum development (e.g., shale gas) may pose significant risks to shallow groundwater. While the potential threat of stray (CH4) gas in aquifers has been acknowledged, few studies have examined the nature of its migration and fate in a shallow groundwater flow system. This study examines the geophysical responses observed from surface during a 72day field-scale simulated CH4 leak in an unconfined sandy aquifer at Canadian Forces Base Borden, Canada, to better understand the transient behaviour of fugitive CH4 gas in the subsurface. Time-lapse ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) were used to monitor the distribution and migration of the gas-phase and assess any impacts to groundwater hydrochemistry. Geophysical measurements captured the transient formation of a CH4 gas plume emanating from the injector, which was accompanied by an increase in total dissolved gas pressure (PTDG). Subsequent reductions in PTDG were accompanied by reduced bulk resistivity around the injector along with an increase in the GPR reflectivity along horizontal bedding reflectors farther downgradient. Repeat temporal GPR reflection profiling identified three events with major peaks in reflectivity, interpreted to represent episodic lateral CH4 gas release events into the aquifer. Here, a gradual increase in PTDG near the injector caused a sudden lateral breakthrough of gas in the direction of groundwater flow, causing free-phase CH4 to migrate much farther than anticipated based on groundwater advection. CH4 accumulated along subtle permeability boundaries demarcated by grain-scale bedding within the aquifer characteristic of numerous Borden-aquifer multi-phase flow experiments. Diminishing reflectivity over a period of days to weeks suggests buoyancy-driven migration to the vadose zone and/or CH4 dissolution into groundwater. Lateral and vertical CH4 migration was primarily governed by subtle, yet measurable heterogeneity and anisotropy in the aquifer.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fadili, Ahmed</author><author>Najib, Saliha</author><author>Mehdi, Khalid</author><author>Riss, Joëlle</author><author>Malaurent, Philippe</author><author>Makan, Abdelhadi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geoelectrical and hydrochemical study for the assessment of seawater intrusion evolution in coastal aquifers of Oualidia, Morocco</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Apparent resistivity maps</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Hydrochemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.09.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092698511730873X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This study aims to assess the evolution of seawater intrusion between 1992 and 2011 periods in the coastal aquifers of Oualidia. To achieve this objective, the combination of geoelectrical and hydrochemical methods was adopted. Apparent resistivity maps, using 74 Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) performed on 1992, allowed to distinguish two different zones. The conductive one, with apparent resistivity ranging between 4 and 86Ω·m, is limited to 1km with respect to the ocean. Meanwhile, the resistant one is much farther from the coastline. Besides, results of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) profiles performed during 2011 are in good agreement with those obtained by apparent resistivity maps. The ERT profiles show a conductive level characterized by low resistivity below 30Ω·m assigned to seawater intrusion effect. Moreover, hydrochemical analysis, performed on 19 wells during three different periods, on June, December 2010 and May 2011, indicates that the most affected part with marine waters was at that time localized in the first kilometer from the ocean, with high amounts of Na+ and Cl− ions. Beyond this fringe, mineralization becomes very weak. Overall, the comparison of old VES with recent ERT coupled with hydrochemical results suggest no important evolution of the salt wedge since 1992.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellefsen, Karl J</author><author>Nelson2, Phillip H</author><author>Horton1, Robert J</author><author>Wright, David L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SUMMARY OF GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR DNAPL REMEDIATION AT SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, SOUTH CAROLINA</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ellefsen et al. - 1997 - SUMMARY OF GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR DNAPL REMEDIATION AT SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, SOUTH CAROLINA.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Remediation Technologies Roundtable, Federal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical Techniques to Locate DNAPLs: Profiles of Federally Funded Projects</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Remediation Technologies Roundtable - 1998 - Geophysical Techniques to Locate DNAPLs Profiles of Federally Funded Projects(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, J.

Impedance measurements were made using a horizontal plane of 12 electrodes positioned at regular intervals around the centre of the column. A 2D inversion algorithm, which incorporated the cylindrical geometry of the column, was used to reconstruct resistivity and phase images from the measured data. Differential time-lapse images of DNAPL movement past the plane of electrodes were generated by the cell-by-cell subtraction of resistivity and phase baseline models from those associated with the DNAPL release stage of the experiment. The DNAPL pulse was clearly delineated as resistive anomalies in the differential time-lapse resistivity images. The spatial extent of the resistive anomalies indicated that in addition to vertical migration, some lateral spreading of the DNAPL had occurred. Residual contamination could be detected after quasi-static conditions were reestablished. Residual DNAPL saturation was estimated from the resistivity model data by applying Archie's second equation. Despite significant measured phase changes due to DNAPL contamination, the differential phase images revealed only weak anomalies associated with DNAPL flow; these anomalies could be seen only in the initial stages of the experiment during peak flow through the plane of electrodes. © 2003 NERC.

However, the spatiotemporal complexity of the transitory flow processes that occur beneath such stream channels are poorly observed and understood. We develop a new approach to characterise the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in dryland streams using pairs of temperature records measured at different depths within the streambed. The approach exploits the fact that the downward propagation of the diel temperature fluctuation from the surface depends on the sediment thermal diffusivity. This is controlled by time-varying fractions of air and water contained in streambed sediments causing a contrast in thermal properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with multi-level temperature and pressure records of a flow event acquired using 12 streambed arrays deployed along a ∼ 12 km dryland channel section. Thermal signatures clearly indicate the presence of water and characterise the vertical flow component as well as the occurrence of horizontal hyporheic flow. We jointly interpret thermal signatures as well as surface and groundwater levels to distinguish four different hydrological regimes: [A] dry channel, [B] surface run-off, [C] pool-riffle sequence, and [D] isolated pools. The occurrence and duration of the regimes depends on the rate at which the infiltrated water redistributes in the subsurface which, in turn, is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the variably saturated sediment. Our results have significant implications for understanding how transitory flows recharge alluvial sediments, influence water quality and underpin dryland ecosystems.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Podgorski, Joel E</author><author>Kinzelbach, Wolfgang K H</author><author>Kgotlhang, Lesego</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using helicopter TEM to delineate fresh water and salt water zones in the aquifer beneath the Okavango Delta, Botswana</title><secondary-title>Advances in Water Resources</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Water Resources</full-title></periodical><pages>265-279</pages><volume>107</volume><keywords><keyword>Freshwater infiltration</keyword><keyword>Hydrogeophysics</keyword><keyword>Saltwater fingering</keyword><keyword>Saltwater infiltration</keyword><keyword>TEM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.06.021</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Podgorski, Kinzelbach, Kgotlhang - 2017 - Using helicopter TEM to delineate fresh water and salt water zones in the aquifer beneath the.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>a b s t r a c t The Okavango Delta is a vast wetland wilderness in the middle of the Kalahari Desert of Botswana. It is a largely closed hydrological system with most water leaving the delta by evapotranspiration. In spite of this, the channels and swamps of the delta remain surprisingly low in salinity. To help understand the hydrological processes at work, we reanalyzed a previous inversion of data collected from a helicopter transient electromagnetic (HTEM) survey of the entire delta and performed an inversion of a high reso-lution dataset recorded during the same survey. Our results show widespread infiltration of fresh water to as much as ∼200 m depth into the regional saline aquifer. Beneath the western delta, freshwater in-filtration extends to only about 80 m depth. Hydrological modeling with SEAWAT confirms that this may be due to rebound of the regional saltwater–freshwater interface following the cessation of surface flood-ing over this part of the delta in the 1880s. Our resistivity models also provide evidence for active and inactive saltwater fingers to as much as ∼100 m beneath islands. These results demonstrate the great ex-tent of freshwater infiltration across the delta and also show that all vegetated areas along the delta's channels and swamps are potential locations for transferring solutes from surface water to an aquifer at depth.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Porsani, Jorge Lu??s</author><author>de Matos Jangelme, Guilherme</author><author>Kipnis, Renato</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GPR survey at Lapa do Santo archaeological site, Lagoa Santa karstic region, Minas Gerais state, Brazil</title><secondary-title>Journal of Archaeological Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Archaeological Science</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Brazil</keyword><keyword>GPR - ground-penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Karst cave</keyword><keyword>Lapa do Santo archaeological site</keyword><keyword>Minas Gerais state</keyword><keyword>Prehistoric archaeology</keyword><keyword>Stratigraphic survey</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0305-4403</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.028</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this work we present and discuss the results of a novel and timely GPR-2D and GPR-3D survey performed at an archaeological rock shelter site, Lapa do Santo, localized in the karstic region of Lagoa Santa, central Brazil.

The GPR results indicated clear geophysical anomalies characterized by hyperbolic reflections and areas with high amplitude sub-horizontal electromagnetic waves. The anomalies observed by GPR were confirmed by the excavation of test units, allowing the identification anthropogenic features such as a fire-hearth structure and wooden artifact, and natural features, such as, tree roots and rocky bodies such as speleothems, boulders and bedrock. The results showed the efficiency of GPR method in identifying potential buried archaeological targets in cave sites within a karstic area, and they oriented to archaeological excavations, reducing costs and increasing the probability of finding archaeological targets in the initial stages of a project. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goebel, Meredith</author><author>Pidlisecky, Adam</author><author>Knight, Rosemary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resistivity imaging reveals complex pattern of saltwater intrusion along Monterey coast</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>Coastal aquifer</keyword><keyword>Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)</keyword><keyword>Groundwater management</keyword><keyword>Monterey</keyword><keyword>Saltwater intrusion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.02.037</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Goebel, Pidlisecky, Knight - 2017 - Resistivity imaging reveals complex pattern of saltwater intrusion along Monterey coast.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>a b s t r a c t Electrical Resistivity Tomography data were acquired along 40 km of the Monterey Bay coast in central California. These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280 m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and fac-tors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intru-sion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geolog-ical flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwa-ter at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone.

A common strategy for acquiring such information is to drill sentinel wells near the coast to monitor changes in water salinity with time. However, installation and operation of sentinel wells is costly and provides limited spatial coverage. We studied the use of noninvasive electromagnetic (EM) geophysical methods as an alternative to installation of monitoring wells for characterizing coastal aquifers. We tested the feasibility of using EM methods at a field site in northern California to identify the potential for and/or presence of hydraulic communication between an unconfined saline aquifer and a confined freshwater aquifer. One-dimensional soundings were acquired using the time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) methods. We compared inverted resistivity models of TDEM and AMT data obtained from several inversion algorithms. We found that multiple interpretations of inverted models can be supported by the same data set, but that there were consistencies between all data sets and inversion algorithms. Results from all collected data sets suggested that EM methods are capable of reliably identifying a saltwater-saturated zone in the unconfined aquifer. Geophysical data indicated that the impermeable clay between aquifers may be more continuous than is supported by current models.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knight, Rosemary</author><author>Walsh, David O.</author><author>Butler, James J.</author><author>Grunewald, Elliot</author><author>Liu, Gaisheng</author><author>Parsekian, Andrew D.</author><author>Reboulet, Edward C.</author><author>Knobbe, Steve</author><author>Barrows, Mercer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NMR Logging to Estimate Hydraulic Conductivity in Unconsolidated Aquifers</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>25810149</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12324</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging provides a new means of estimating the hydraulic conductivity (K) of unconsolidated aquifers. The estimation of K from the measured NMR parameters can be performed using the Schlumberger-Doll Research (SDR) equation, which is based on the Kozeny-Carman equation and initially developed for obtaining permeability from NMR logging in petroleum reservoirs. The SDR equation includes empirically determined constants. Decades of research for petroleum applications have resulted in standard values for these constants that can provide accurate estimates of permeability in consolidated formations. The question we asked: Can standard values for the constants be defined for hydrogeologic applications that would yield accurate estimates of K in unconsolidated aquifers? Working at 10 locations at three field sites in Kansas and Washington, USA, we acquired NMR and K data using direct-push methods over a 10- to 20-m depth interval in the shallow subsurface. Analysis of pairs of NMR and K data revealed that we could dramatically improve K estimates by replacing the standard petroleum constants with new constants, optimal for estimating K in the unconsolidated materials at the field sites. Most significant was the finding that there was little change in the SDR constants between sites. This suggests that we can define a new set of constants that can be used to obtain high resolution, cost-effective estimates of K from NMR logging in unconsolidated aquifers. This significant result has the potential to change dramatically the approach to determining K for hydrogeologic applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beamish, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The bedrock electrical conductivity map of the UK</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><volume>96</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.06.001</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Airborne electromagnetic (AEM) surveys, when regionally extensive, may sample a wide-range of geological formations. The majority of AEM surveys can provide estimates of apparent (half-space) conductivity and such derived data provide a mapping capability. Depth discrimination of the geophysical mapping information is controlled by the bandwidth of each particular system. The objective of this study is to assess the geological information contained in accumulated frequency-domain AEM survey data from the UK where existing geological mapping can be considered well-established. The methodology adopted involves a simple GIS-based, spatial join of AEM and geological databases. A lithology-based classification of bedrock is used to provide an inherent association with the petrophysical rock parameters controlling bulk conductivity. At a scale of 1:625k, the UK digital bedrock geological lexicon comprises just 86 lithological classifications compared with 244 standard lithostratigraphic assignments. The lowest common AEM survey frequency of 3. kHz is found to provide an 87% coverage (by area) of the UK formations. The conductivities of the unsampled classes have been assigned on the basis of inherent lithological associations between formations. The statistical analysis conducted uses over 8. M conductivity estimates and provides a new UK national scale digital map of near-surface bedrock conductivity. The new baseline map, formed from central moments of the statistical distributions, allows assessments/interpretations of data exhibiting departures from the norm. The digital conductivity map developed here is believed to be the first such UK geophysical map compilation for over 75. years. The methodology described can also be applied to many existing AEM data sets. ?? 2013 The Author.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhlemann, S.</author><author>Smith, A.</author><author>Chambers, J.</author><author>Dixon, N.</author><author>Dijkstra, T.</author><author>Haslam, E.</author><author>Meldrum, P.</author><author>Merritt, A.</author><author>Gunn, D.</author><author>Mackay, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of ground-based monitoring techniques applied to landslide investigations</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><volume>253</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.10.027</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A landslide complex in the Whitby Mudstone Formation at Hollin Hill, North Yorkshire, UK is periodically re-activated in response to rainfall-induced pore-water pressure fluctuations. This paper compares long-term measurements (i.e., 2009-2014) obtained from a combination of monitoring techniques that have been employed together for the first time on an active landslide. The results highlight the relative performance of the different techniques, and can provide guidance for researchers and practitioners for selecting and installing appropriate monitoring techniques to assess unstable slopes. Particular attention is given to the spatial and temporal resolutions offered by the different approaches that include: Real Time Kinematic-GPS (RTK-GPS) monitoring of a ground surface marker array, conventional inclinometers, Shape Acceleration Arrays (SAA), tilt meters, active waveguides with Acoustic Emission (AE) monitoring, and piezometers. High spatial resolution information has allowed locating areas of stability and instability across a large slope. This has enabled identification of areas where further monitoring efforts should be focused. High temporal resolution information allowed the capture of 'S'-shaped slope displacement-time behaviour (i.e. phases of slope acceleration, deceleration and stability) in response to elevations in pore-water pressures. This study shows that a well-balanced suite of monitoring techniques that provides high temporal and spatial resolutions on both measurement and slope scale is necessary to fully understand failure and movement mechanisms of slopes. In the case of the Hollin Hill landslide it enabled detailed interpretation of the geomorphological processes governing landslide activity. It highlights the benefit of regularly surveying a network of GPS markers to determine areas for installation of movement monitoring techniques that offer higher resolution both temporally and spatially. The small sensitivity of tilt meter measurements to translational movements limited the ability to record characteristic 'S'-shaped landslide movements at Hollin Hill, which were identified using SAA and AE measurements. This high sensitivity to landslide movements indicates the applicability of SAA and AE monitoring to be used in early warning systems, through detecting and quantifying accelerations of slope movement.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beff, L.</author><author>G??nther, T.</author><author>Vandoorne, B.</author><author>Couvreur, V.</author><author>Javaux, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three-dimensional monitoring of soil water content in a maize field using Electrical Resistivity Tomography</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>17</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1027-5606</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-17-595-2013</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A good understanding of the soil water content (SWC) distribution at the field scale is essential to improve the management of water, soil and crops. Recent studies proved that Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) opens interesting perspectives in the determination of the SWC distribution in 3 dimensions (3-D). This study was conducted (i) to check and validate how ERT is able to monitor SWC distribution in a maize field during the late growing season; and (ii) to investigate how maize plants and rainfall affect the dynamics of SWC distribution. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to validate ERT-inverted SWC values. Evolution of water mass balance was also calculated to check whether ERT was capable of giving a reliable estimate of soil water stock evolution. It is observed that ERT was able to give the same average SWC as TDR ( R 2 = 0.98). In addition, ERT gives better estimates of the water stock than TDR thanks to its higher spatial resolution. The high resolution of ERT measurements also allows for the discrimination of SWC heterogeneities. The SWC distribution showed that alternation of maize rows and inter-rows was the main influencing factor of the SWC distribution. The drying patterns were linked to the root profiles, with drier zones under the maize rows. During short periods, with negligible rainfall, the SWC decrease took place mainly in the two upper soil horizons and in the inter-row area. In contrast, rainfall increased the SWC mostly under the maize rows and in the upper soil layer. Nevertheless, the total amount of rainfall during the growing season was not sufficient to modify the SWC patterns induced by the maize rows. During the experimental time, there was hardly any SWC redistribution from maize rows to inter-rows. Yet, lateral redistribution from inter-rows to maize rows induced by potential gradient generates SWC decrease in the inter-row area and in the deeper soil horizons. © Author(s) 2013.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilkinson, Paul B.</author><author>Uhlemann, Sebastian</author><author>Meldrum, Philip I.</author><author>Chambers, Jonathan E.</author><author>Carrière, Simon</author><author>Oxby, Lucy S.</author><author>Loke, M.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.Adaptive optimal experimental design methods use previous data and results to guide the choice and design of future experiments. This paper describes the formulation of an adaptive survey design technique to produce optimal resistivity imaging surveys for time-lapse geoelectrical monitoring experiments. These survey designs are time-dependent and, compared to dipole-dipole or static optimized surveys that do not change over time, focus a greater degree of the image resolution on regions of the subsurface that are actively changing. The adaptive optimization method is validated using a controlled laboratory monitoring experiment comprising a well-defined cylindrical target moving along a trajectory that changes its depth and lateral position. The algorithm is implemented on a standard PC in conjunction with a modified automated multichannel resistivity imaging system. Data acquisition using the adaptive survey designs requires no more time or power than with comparable standard surveys, and the algorithm processing takes place while the system batteries recharge. The results show that adaptively designed optimal surveys yield a quantitative increase in image quality over and above that produced by using standard dipole-dipole or static (time-independent) optimized surveys.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gunn, D.

The methodology is based upon development of a robust relationship between fill resistivity and moisture content and its use in the transformation of resistivity image differences in terms of relative moisture content changes. Moisture level and moisture content movement applications are exemplified using two case histories from the UK. The first is the BIONICS embankment, near Newcastle (NE England), which was constructed in 2005 using varying degrees of compaction of a medium plasticity sandy, silty clay derived from the Durham Till. The second is a Victorian embankment south of Nottingham (Central England), constructed in 1897 using end tipping of Late Triassic siltstone and mudstone taken from local cuttings. Climate change forecasts for the UK suggest that transportation earthworks will be subjected to more sustained, higher temperatures and increased intensity of rainfall. Within the context of preventative geotechnical asset maintenance, ERT imaging can provide a monitoring framework to manage moisture movement and identify failure trigger conditions within embankments, thus supporting on demand inspection scheduling and low cost early interventions.

Geophysical techniques may permit non-invasive, real time monitoring of microbial degradation of hydrocarbon. We performed complex resistivity (CR) measurements in conjunction with geochemical data analysis on three microbial-stimulated and two control columns to investigate changes in electrical properties during EtOH biodegradation processes in porous media. A Debye Decomposition approach was applied to determine the chargeability (m), normalized chargeability (m n) and time constant (τ) of the polarization magnitude and relaxation length scale as a function of time. The CR responses showed a clear distinction between the bioaugmented and control columns in terms of real (σ′) and imaginary (σ″) conductivity, phase (α) and apparent formation factor (Fapp). Unlike the control columns, a substantial decrease in σ′ and increase in Fapp occurred at an early time (within 4 days) of the experiment for all three bioaugmented columns. The observed decrease in σ′ is opposite to previous studies on hydrocarbon biodegradation. These columns also exhibited increases in α (up to ~ 9 mrad) and σ″ (up to two order of magnitude higher) 5 weeks after microbial inoculation. Variations in m and mn were consistent with temporal changes in α and σ″ responses, respectively. Temporal geochemical changes and high resolution scanning electron microscopy imaging corroborated the CR findings, thus indicating the sensitivity of CR measurements to EtOH biodegradation processes. Our results offer insight into the potential application of CR measurements for long-term monitoring of biogeochemical and mineralogical changes during intrinsic and induced EtOH biodegradation in the subsurface. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Asadzadeh, Saeid</author><author>de Souza Filho, Carlos Roberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral remote sensing for onshore seepage characterization: A critical overview</title><secondary-title>Earth-Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth-Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>48-72</pages><volume>168</volume><keywords><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Exploration</keyword><keyword>Gas-plume</keyword><keyword>Hydrocarbon</keyword><keyword>Methane budget</keyword><keyword>Microseepage system</keyword><keyword>Onshore</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>Seepage</keyword><keyword>Spectroscopy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2017.03.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282521630455X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
In this article, we overview the application of spectral remote sensing data collected by multi-, and hyperspectral instruments in the visible-near infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and longwave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths for characterization of seepage systems as an exploration indicator of subsurface hydrocarbon (HC) accumulations. Two seepage systems namely macro-, and microseepage are recognized. A macroseepage is defined as visible indications of oil and gas on the surface and in the air detectable directly by a remote sensing approach. A microseepage is defined as invisible traces of light HCs in soils and sediments that are detectable by its secondary footprints in the strata, hence an indirect remote sensing target. Based on these broad categories, firstly, a comprehensive set of well-described and reliable remote sensing case studies available in the literature are thoroughly reviewed and then systematically assessed as regards the methodological shortcomings and scantiness in data gathering, processing, and interpretation. The work subsequently attempts to go through seminal papers published on microseepage concept and interrelated geochemical and geophysical techniques, exhumed HC reservoirs, lab-based spectroscopic analysis of petroleum and other related disciplines from a remote sensing standpoint. The aim is to enrich the discussion and highlight the still unexplored capabilities of this technique in accomplishing exploration objectives using the concept of seepage system. Aspects of seepage phenomenon in environmental pollution and uncertainties associated with their role in global warming are also underlined. This work benefits from illustrative products generated over two study areas located in the Ventura Basin, State of California, USA and the Tucano Basin, State of Bahia, Brazil known to host distinctive macro-, and microseepage systems, respectively. In conclusion, we recommend further research over a diverse range of seepage systems and advocate for a mature conceptual model for microseepage phenomenon.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kiessling, Dana</author><author>Schmidt-Hattenberger, Cornelia</author><author>Schuett, Hartmut</author><author>Schilling, Frank</author><author>Krueger, Kay</author><author>Schoebel, Birgit</author><author>Danckwardt, Erik</author><author>Kummerow, Juliane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geoelectrical methods for monitoring geological CO2 storage: First results from cross-hole and surface-downhole measurements from the CO2SINK test site at Ketzin (Germany)</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Buried electrodes</keyword><keyword>CO2 storage</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)</keyword><keyword>Field data</keyword><keyword>Geoelectric monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1750-5836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijggc.2010.05.001</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The feasibility of monitoring CO2 migration in a saline aquifer at a depth of about 650m with cross-hole and surface-downhole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is investigated at the CO2SINK test site close to Ketzin (Germany). The permanent vertical electrical resistivity array (VERA) consists of 45 electrodes (15 in the injection well Ktzi201 and 15 in each of the two observation wells Ktzi200 and Ktzi202), successfully placed on the electrically insulated casings, in the depth range of about 590-740 m with a spacing of about 10 m. The three Ketzin wells are arranged as perpendicular triangle with distances of 50 and 100m. First synthetic modelling studies indicate an increase of the electrical resistivity of about 200% caused by CO2 injection, corresponding to a bulk CO2 saturation of 50%, which is in good agreement with laboratory studies. Finite difference inversion of field data delivers three-dimensional resistivity distributions between the wells which are consistent with the reservoir modelling studies. To increase the limited observation area provided by the cross-hole measurements, additional surface-downhole measurements were deployed. A main CO2 migration in SE-NW direction is deduced from surface to downhole resistivity experiments. The first cross-hole time-lapse results show that the resolution and the coverage of the electrode array in the Ketzin setting are sufficient to resolve the expected resistivity changes on the characteristic length scale of the electrode array. Significant resistivity changes could be measured, however, detailed information on the CO2 plume could not be resolved yet by VERA under the existing geological circumstances. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Modiriasari, A.</author><author>Bobet, A.</author><author>Pyrak-Nolte, L.J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Active Seismic Monitoring of Crack Initiation, Propagation, and Coalescence in Rock</title><secondary-title>Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Crack coalescence</keyword><keyword>Crack initiation and propagation</keyword><keyword>Digital image correlation (DIC)</keyword><keyword>Mixed-mode fracture</keyword><keyword>Seismic wave monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00603-017-1235-x</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>© 2017 Springer-Verlag WienActive seismic monitoring was used to detect and characterize crack initiation, crack propagation and crack coalescence in pre-cracked rock specimens. Uniaxial compression tests were conducted on Indiana limestone specimens with two parallel pre-existing cracks. During the experiments, the mechanically induced cracks around the flaw tips were monitored by measuring surface displacements using digital image correlation (DIC). Transmitted and reflected compressional and shear waves through the specimens were also recorded during the loading to detect any damage or cracking phenomena. The amplitude of transmitted compressional and shear waves decreased with uniaxial compression. However, the rate of decrease of the amplitude of the transmitted waves intensified well before the initiation of tensile cracks. In addition, a distinct minimum in the amplitude of transmitted waves occurred close to coalescence. The normalized amplitude of waves reflecting from the new cracks increased before new tensile and shear cracks initiated around the flaw tips. In addition, the location of new cracks could be identified using the traveling time of the reflected waves. The experimental results indicate that changes in normalized amplitude of transmitted and reflected signals associated with crack initiation and crack coalescence were detected much earlier than with DIC, at a load of about 80–90% of the load at which the cracks appeared on the surface. The tests show conclusively that active wave monitoring is an effective tool to detect damage and new cracks in rock, as well as to estimate the location of the new cracks.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhlemann, S.

The effectiveness of these services is mainly controlled by hydrological processes, which can be highly variable both spatially and temporally due to structural complexity and seasonality. Spatial analysis of 2-D geoelectrical monitoring data integrated into the interpretation of conventional hydrological data has been implemented to provide a detailed understanding of hydrological processes in a riparian wetland. A two-layered hydrological system was observed in the peat. In the lower part of the peat, upwelling of deeper groundwater from underlying deposits was considered the driver for a 30% increase in peat resistivity during Winter/Spring. In Spring/Summer there was a 60% decrease in resistivity in the near-surface peats due to plant transpiration and/or microbial activity. Water exchange between the layers only appeared to be initiated following large drops in the encircling surface water stage. For the first time, we demonstrated that automated interpretation of geoelectrical data can be used to quantify ground movement in the vertical direction. Here, we applied this method to quantify shrink-swell of expandable soils, affecting hydrological parameters, such as, porosity and permeability. This study shows that an integrated interpretation of hydrological and geophysical data can significantly improve the understanding of wetland hydrological processes. Potentially, this approach can provide the basis for the evaluation of ecosystem services and may aid in the optimization of wetland management strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doetsch, Joseph</author><author>Fiandaca, Gianluca</author><author>Auken, Esben</author><author>Christiansen, Anders Vest</author><author>Cahill, Aaron Graham</author><author>Jakobsen, Rasmus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Field-scale time-domain spectral induced polarization monitoring of geochemical changes induced by injected CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a shallow aquifer</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><volume>80</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/geo2014-0315.1</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>ABSTRACTContamination of potable groundwater by leaking CO2 is a potential risk of carbon sequestration.

This paper presents various geophysical methods of exploring geothermal reservoir. Some comparisons, advantages, and disadvantages of each method are discussed. It was found that, the most successful methods are aimed at parameters that are directly influenced by the geothermal activity, such as Geophysical well logs, self-potential, Geoelectrical and thermal methods, and are usually referred as direct methods. Other methods explore the physical parameters of the host rock, including magnetic properties, density and seismic velocity, and are usually referred as indirect or structural methods. It appears that, direct methods give information on parameters that are influenced by the geothermal activity, while the structural methods give information on geological parameters which may reveal structures or geological bodies that are important for the understanding of the geothermal system.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhlemann, Sebastian</author><author>Chambers, Jonathan</author><author>Wilkinson, Paul</author><author>Maurer, Hansruedi</author><author>Merritt, Andrew</author><author>Meldrum, Philip</author><author>Kuras, Oliver</author><author>Gunn, David</author><author>Smith, Alister</author><author>Dijkstra, Tom</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Four-dimensional imaging of moisture dynamics during landslide reactivation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface</full-title></periodical><volume>122</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2016JF003983</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Landslides pose significant risks to communities and infrastructure, and mitigating these risks relies on understanding landslide causes and triggering processes. It has been shown that geophysical surveys can significantly contribute to the characterization of unstable slopes. However, hydrological processes can be temporally and spatially heterogeneous, requiring their related properties to be monitored over time. Geoelectrical monitoring can provide temporal and volumetric distributions of electrical resistivity, which are directly related to moisture content. To date, studies demonstrating this capability have been restricted to 2-D sections, which are insufficient to capture the full degree of spatial heterogeneity. This study is the first to employ 4-D (i.e., 3-D time lapse) resistivity imaging on an active landslide, providing long-term data (3 years) highlighting the evolution of moisture content prior to landslide reactivation and showing its decline post reactivation. Crucially, the time-lapse inversion methodology employed here incorporates movements of the electrodes on the unstable surface. Although seasonal characteristics dominate the shallow moisture dynamics during the first 2 years with surficial drying in summer and wetting in winter, in the months preceding reactivation, moisture content increased by more than 45% throughout the slope. This is in agreement with independent data showing a significant rise in piezometric heads and shallow soil moisture contents as a result of prolonged and intense rainfall. Based on these results, remediation measures could be designed and early-warning systems implemented. Thus, resistivity monitoring that can allow for moving electrodes provides a new means for the effective mitigation of landslide risk.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hermans, Thomas</author><author>Nguyen, Fr??d??ric</author><author>Caers, Jef</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Uncertainty in training image-based inversion of hydraulic head data constrained to ERT data: Workflow and case study</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><volume>51</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1944-7973</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2014WR016460</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In inverse problems, investigating uncertainty in the posterior distribution of model parameters is as important as matching data. In recent years, most efforts have focused on techniques to sample the posterior distribution with reasonable computational costs. Within a Bayesian context, this posterior depends on the prior distribution. However, most of the studies ignore modeling the prior with realistic geological uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a workflow inspired by a Popper-Bayes philosophy that data should first be used to falsify models, then only be considered for matching. We propose a workflow consisting of three steps: (1) in defining the prior, we interpret multiple alternative geological scenarios from literature (architecture of facies) and site-specific data (proportions of facies). Prior spatial uncertainty is modeled using multiple-point geostatistics, where each scenario is defined using a training image. (2) We validate these prior geological scenarios by simulating electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data on realizations of each scenario and comparing them to field ERT in a lower dimensional space. In this second step, the idea is to probabilistically falsify scenarios with ERT, meaning that scenarios which are incompatible receive an updated probability of zero while compatible scenarios receive a nonzero updated belief. (3) We constrain the hydrogeological model with hydraulic head and ERT using a stochastic search method. The workflow is applied to a synthetic and a field case studies in an alluvial aquifer. This study highlights the importance of considering and estimating prior uncertainty (without data) through a process of probabilistic falsification.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marker, P.

The largest source of uncertainty in such models is the hydrostratigraphic model. Geometry and configuration of hydrogeological units are often poorly determined from hydrogeological data alone. Due to sparse sampling in space, lithological borehole logs may overlook structures that are important for groundwater flow at larger scales. Good spatial coverage along with high spatial resolution makes airborne time-domain electromagnetic (AEM) data valuable for the structural input to large-scale groundwater models. We present a novel method to automatically integrate large AEM data-sets and lithological information into large-scale hydrological models. Clay-fraction maps are produced by translating geophysical resistivity into clay-fraction values using lithological borehole information. Voxel models of electrical resistivity and clay fraction are classified into hydrostratigraphic zones using &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means clustering. Hydraulic conductivity values of the zones are estimated by hydrological calibration using hydraulic head and stream discharge observations. The method is applied to a Danish case study. Benchmarking hydrological performance by comparison of simulated hydrological state variables, the cluster model performed competitively. Calibrations of 11 hydrostratigraphic cluster models with 1–11 hydraulic conductivity zones showed improved hydrological performance with increasing number of clusters. Beyond the 5-cluster model hydrological performance did not improve. Due to reproducibility and possibility of method standardization and automation, we believe that hydrostratigraphic model generation with the proposed method has important prospects for groundwater models used in water resources management.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Revil, André</author><author>Kessouri, Pauline</author><author>Torres-Verdín, Carlos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical conductivity, induced polarization, and permeability of the Fontainebleau sandstone</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><volume>79</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>10.1190/geo2014-0036.1</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/geo2014-0036.1</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The electrical conductivity of clay-free sandstones is customarily assumed to have negligible surface conductivity contribution. The Fontainebleau sandstone, a clean sandstone with relatively coarse (∼250  μm) and well-rounded silica grains and silica cement, exhibits surface conductivity along the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains. A recently developed volume-averaging model for the electrical conductivity was used to determine intrinsic formation factor and surface conductivity from electrical conductivity measurements performed at seven salinities with NaCl solutions. The bulk tortuosity of the pore space influenced the surface conductivity in a predictable way. Formation factor and permeability can be determined as a function of the porosity using the equations developed by Archie for the formation factor, and Revil and Cathles for the permeability. In both the cases, the data emphasize the existence of a percolation threshold of about 0.02 (2%) in porosity. Once corrected for the effect of this percolation threshold, the porosity exponent of Archie’s equation was approximately equal to 1.5 as predicted from the differential effective medium theory for a pack of spherical grains suspended in an electrolyte. We illustrated that permeability can be predicted, within one order of magnitude, from surface conductivity, porosity, and formation factor. Spectral-induced polarization data indicated that the in-phase conductivity was nearly frequency-independent (in the frequency range from 1 to 10 kHz) whereas the quadrature conductivity displayed a relationship between the surface conductivity and a peak frequency likely related to the pore throat size determined from mercury porosimetry measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foged, N.</author><author>Marker, P.

The parameter of interest is the clay fraction, expressed as the relative length of clay units in a depth interval. The clay fraction is obtained from lithological logs and the clay fraction from the resistivity is obtained by establishing a simple petrophysical relationship, a translator function, between resistivity and the clay fraction. Through inversion we use the lithological data and the resistivity data to determine the optimum spatially distributed translator function. Applying the translator function we get a 3-D clay fraction model, which holds information from the resistivity data set and the borehole data set in one variable. Finally, we use &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means clustering to generate a 3-D model of the subsurface structures. We apply the procedure to the Norsminde survey in Denmark, integrating approximately 700 boreholes and more than 100 000 resistivity models from an airborne survey in the parameterization of the 3-D model covering 156 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The complex heterogeneity of fractured rock poses enormous challenges to groundwater remediation professionals, and new methods are needed to cost-effectively infer fracture and fracture-zone locations, orientations and properties, and to develop conceptual site models for flow and transport. Despite the potential of geophysical methods to &quot; see &quot; between boreholes, two issues have impeded the adoption of geophysical methods by remediation professionals. First, geophysical results are commonly only indirectly related to the properties of interest (e.g., permeability) to remediation pro-fessionals, and qualitative or quantitative interpretation is required to convert geophysical results to hydrogeologic information. Additional demonstration/evaluation projects are needed in the site reme-diation literature to fully transfer geophysical methods from research to practice. Second, geophysical methods are commonly viewed as inherently risky by remediation professionals. Although it is widely understood that a given method may or may not work at a particular site, the reasons are not always clear to end users of geophysical products. Synthetic modeling tools are used in research to assess the potential of a particular method to successfully image a target, but these tools are not widely used in industry. Here, we seek to advance the application of geophysical methods to solve problems facing remediation professionals with respect to fractured-rock aquifers. To this end, we (1) provide an over-view of geophysical methods applied to characterization and monitoring of fractured-rock aquifers; (2) review case studies showcasing different geophysical methods; and (3) discuss best practices for method selection and rejection based on synthetic modeling and decision support tools.

Due to the labour-intensive nature of determining θ, non-invasive electromagnetic (EM) induction techniques have been used. However, predicting depth-specific θ is a challenge because EM instruments measure the integral depth of the soil's apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Recently, “true” electrical conductivity with depth produced by inverse modelling of ECa has been employed to establish empirical models of θ. However, the potential to combine empirical models with soil physical models using data assimilation such as ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has not been explored. Along a 480-m transect with varying soil texture profiles, repeated ECa data were collected using a DUALEM-421S on 20 days over a 40-day period. A quasi-2d inversion algorithm was used to convert the temperature corrected ECa data to σ. An empirical model (artificial neural network) that predicted θ was calibrated using σ values, elevation, and topographic wetness index, as well as the mean and range of σ for each depth and each site over the whole study period. A physical soil-water tipping bucket model was also constructed using θ measured by soil moisture sensors. Afterwards, the EnKF approach was applied to 8 profiles along the transect separately combining both the empirical and the physical models. The results with the EnFK modelling (Lin's concordance = 0.89) were superior to the physical model and superior or equivalent to the empirical model for loam, clay and duplex soil profiles. In order to improve the prediction of θ dynamics, a more robust physical model could be used. In addition, correction of the diurnal effects of ECa data and redefining the model and measurement errors of the EnFK to account for the temporal dependence should be considered.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Malehmir, A.</author><author>Socco, L.

That potential will continue to escalate with current and continued human encroachment into risk areas. With the help of geophysical techniques many of those risks can be better understood and quantified, thereby minimized and at least partly mitigated through accurate, site-specific, and proper planning and engineering. On occasions these hazards simply cannot be avoided, but better characterization and therefore understanding of the subsurface geology and natural processes responsible for the threats is possible through integration of various cost-effective geophysical methods with relevant geotechnical, geomechanical, and hydrogeological methods. With the enhanced characterization possible when geophysics is incorporated into natural hazard analysis, potential risks can be better quantified and remediation plans tuned to minimize the threat most natural hazards present to civilizations. In this article we will first review common geophysical methods that can be and have been utilized in studying natural hazard prone areas, then we provide selected case studies and approaches using predominantly our own examples, and finally a look into the future detailing how these methods and technologies can be better implemented and thereby more time- and cost-effective and provide improved results.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donohue, Shane</author><author>Long, Michael</author><author>O'Connor, Peter</author><author>Helle, Tonje Eide</author><author>Pfaffhuber, Andreas Aspmo</author><author>R??moen, Magnus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-method geophysical mapping of quick clay</title><secondary-title>Near Surface Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Near Surface Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3997/1873-0604.2012003</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Marine clay deposits in coastal, post-submarine areas of Scandinavia and North America may be subjected to quick clay landslides and hence significant efforts are being taken to map their occur- rence and extent. The purpose of this paper is to assess the use of a number of geophysical tech- niques for identifying quick clay. The investigated area, Smørgrav, located in southern Norway has a history of quick clay sliding, the most recent event occurring in 1984. Geophysical techniques that are used include electromagnetic conductivity mapping, electrical resistivity tomography, seismic refraction and multichannel analysis of surface waves. These results are compared to geotechnical data from bore samples, rotary pressure soundings and cone penetration testing. A number of these approaches have proved promising for identifying quick clay, in particular electrical resistivity tomography and electromagnetics, which delineated a zone of quick clay that had previously been confirmed by rotary pressure soundings and sampling. Seismic refraction was useful for determin- ing the sediment distribution as well as for indicating the presence of shallow bedrock whereas the multichannel analysis of surface-waves approach suggested differences between the intact stiffness of quick and unleached clay. It is observed that quick clay investigations using discrete rotary pres- sure soundings can be significantly enhanced by using, in particular, electrical resistivity tomogra- phy profiles to link together the information between test locations, perhaps significantly reducing the need for large numbers of soundings.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hausmann, Jörg</author><author>Steinel, Hannes</author><author>Kreck, Manuel</author><author>Werban, Ulrike</author><author>Vienken, Thomas</author><author>Dietrich, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two-dimensional geomorphological characterization of a filled abandoned meander using geophysical methods and soil sampling</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Combination of geophysical methods</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Geomorphological characterization</keyword><keyword>Ground penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>MASW</keyword><keyword>Refraction seismic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.07.009</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Using geophysical methods for the geomorphological characterization of subsurface features has numerous advantages over traditional exploration methods, because of their noninvasive and rapid nature. In this study, we compared the results of four geophysical methods with each other. We also discuss their possibilities and limitations in a geomorphological investigation. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), refraction seismic (RS), ground penetrating radar (GPR), and multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) methods were applied at an abandoned meander in northern Saxony to map a predefined structure. By combining these methods, we were able to characterize and delineate subsurface features of the abandoned meander, including a point bar, a channel, and a cutbank. Core samples obtained from sonic drilling were used to validate the findings of both seismic methods. However, we found that electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar lacked penetration depth and could only be used to resolve shallower subsurface layers. The ERT, GPR, RS, and MASW can be used to gather images of subsurface structures. The MASW in particular provides supplementary information about the channel's internal structure (with respect to lateral and vertical resolution). Besides fluvial-morphological features, we also detected inverse velocity structures within the channel. This allowed us to characterize the abandoned meander using information about its layer distribution and material composition. However, we were only able to characterize and delineate the subsurface features of the abandoned meander by combining all of the aforementioned methods. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arato, Alessandro</author><author>Wehrer, Markus</author><author>Biró, Borbala</author><author>Godio, Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integration of geophysical, geochemical and microbiological data for a comprehensive small-scale characterizationof an aged LNAPL-contaminated site</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Aquifer</keyword><keyword>Bio-degradation</keyword><keyword>Biological assays</keyword><keyword>Borehole geophysics</keyword><keyword>Complex resistivity</keyword><keyword>Crude oil</keyword><keyword>Geochemical monitoring</keyword><keyword>Induced polarization</keyword><keyword>Multi-component NAPL</keyword><keyword>Multilevel piezometer</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1135601321</isbn><accession-num>24091526</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11356-013-2171-2</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Characterization of aged hydrocarbon-contaminated sites is often a challenge due to the heterogeneity of subsurface conditions. Geoelectrical methods can aid in the characterization of such sites due to their non-invasive nature, but need to be supported by geochemical and microbiological data. In this study, a combination of respective methods was used to characterize an aged light non-aqueous phase liquid-contaminated site, which was the scene of a crude oil blow-out in 1994. As a consequence, a significant amount of crude oil was released into the subsurface. Complex resistivity has been acquired, both along single boreholes and in cross-hole configuration, in a two-borehole test site addressed with electrodes, to observe the electrical behaviour at the site over a two-year period (2010-2011). Geoelectrical response has been compared to results of the analysis of hydrocarbon contamination in soil and groundwater samples. Geochemical parameters of groundwater have been observed by collecting samples in a continuous multi-channel tubing (CMT) piezometer system. We have also performed a biological characterization on soil samples by drilling new boreholes close to the monitoring wells. Particular attention has been given to the characterization of the smear zone that is the sub-soil zone affected by the seasonal groundwater fluctuations. In the smear zone, trapped hydrocarbons were present, serving as organic substrate for chemical and biological degradation, as was indicated by an increase of microbial biomass and activity as well as ferrogenic-sulfidogenic conditions in the smear zone. The results show a good agreement between the intense electrical anomaly and the peaks of total organic matter and degradation by-products, particularly enhanced in the smear zone.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Camporese, M.</author><author>Cassiani, G.</author><author>Deiana, R.</author><author>Salandin, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of local hydraulic properties from electrical resistivity tomography monitoring of a three-dimensional synthetic tracer test experiment</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>0043-1397</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2011WR010528</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In recent years geophysical methods have become increasingly popular for hydrological applications. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) represents a potentially powerful tool for subsurface solute transport characterization since a full picture of the spatiotemporal evolution of the process can be obtained. However, the quantitative interpretation of tracer tests is difficult because of the uncertainty related to the geoelectrical inversion, the constitutive models linking geophysical and hydrological quantities, and the a priori unknown heterogeneous properties of natural formations. Here an approach based on the Lagrangian formulation of transport and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation technique is applied to assess the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity K by incorporating time-lapse cross-hole ERT data. Electrical data consist of three- dimensional cross-hole ERT images generated for a synthetic tracer test in a heterogeneous aquifer. Under the assumption that the solute spreads as a passive tracer, for high Peclet numbers the spatial moments of the evolving plume are dominated by the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity. The assimilation of the electrical conductivity 4D images allows updating of the hydrological state as well as the spatial distribution of K. Thus, delineation of the tracer plume and estimation of the local aquifer heterogeneity can be achieved at the same time by means of this interpretation of time-lapse electrical images from tracer tests. We assess the impact on the performance of the hydrological inversion of (i) the uncertainty inherently affecting ERT inversions in terms of tracer concentration and (ii) the choice of the prior statistics of K. Our findings show that realistic ERT images can be integrated into a hydrological model even within an uncoupled inverse modeling framework. The reconstruction of the hydraulic conductivity spatial distribution is satisfactory in the portion of the domain directly covered by the passage of the tracer. Aside from the issues commonly affecting inverse models, the proposed approach is subject to the problem of the filter inbreeding and the retrieval performance is sensitive to the choice of K prior geostatistical parameters.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breede, K.</author><author>Kemna, A.</author><author>Esser, O.</author><author>Zimmermann, E.</author><author>Vereecken, H.</author><author>Huisman, J.

To better understand the mechanisms causing polarization and to extend the range of SIP applications to the vadose zone, it is important to investigate how the SIP response is affected by water saturation. Therefore, sand and sand- clay mixtures were drained in several steps using a novel measurement set-up allowing SIP measurements with a high accuracy. The measured SIP spectra were interpreted by Debye decomposition, which provided a relaxation time distribution and a chargeability distribution that was converted to a normalized total chargeability. The results showed that the normalized total chargeability of the fully saturated samples increased with increasing clay content due to the larger specific surface area of the clay minerals. Furthermore, normalized total chargeability first increased and then decreased with decreasing saturation for the pure sand and the 5 % sand-clay mixture. The normalized total chargeability values for the 10 % and 20 % sand-clay mixtures only decreased with saturation. The peak relaxation time of the sand- clay mixtures clearly decreased with decreasing saturation. Existing grain-size based mechanistic models for SIP are not able to explain the observed behavior, and the observed relationship between relaxation time and saturation suggests that model concepts relying on polarization processes in the pore space are warranted to explain the measurements on variably saturated porous media presented here.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samyn, K.</author><author>Travelletti, J.</author><author>Bitri, A.</author><author>Grandjean, G.</author><author>Malet, J.

A challenge to progress in the forecast of landslide acceleration in terms of early-warning is therefore to characterize the 3D geometry of the unstable mass at a high level of spatial resolution, both in the horizontal and vertical directions, by integrating information from different surveying techniques. For such characterization, seismic investigations are potentially of a great interest. In the case of complex structures, the measure and the processing of seismic data need to be performed in 3D. The objective of this work is to present the development of a 3D extension of a seismic refraction traveltime tomography technique based on a Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT). First the processing algorithm is detailed and its performance is discussed, and second an application to the La Valette complex landslide is presented. Inversion of first-arrival traveltimes produces a 3D tomogram that underlines the presence of many areas characterized by low P-wave velocity of 500-1800m.s -1. These low P-wave velocity structures result from the presence of reworked blocks, surficial cracks and in-depth fracture zones. These structures seem to extend to around 25m in depth over a 80×130m area. Based on borehole geotechnical data and previous geophysical investigations, an interface corresponding to an internal slip surface can be suspected near the isovalue of 1200m.s -1 at a depth of -10 to -15m. The stable substratum is characterized by higher values of P-wave velocity of 1800-3000m.s -1. The features identified in the 3D tomogram allow to better (1) delineate the boundary between the landslide and the surrounding stable slopes, and (2) understand the morphological structures within the landslide at a hectometric scale. The integration of the 3D seismic tomography interpretation to previous geophysical acquisitions using a geostatistical approach allows to construct a 3D geometrical model of the middle and lower part of the La Valette landslide, and to estimate the volume of the unstable mass. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Dam, Remke L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Landform characterization using geophysics-Recent advances, applications, and emerging tools</title><secondary-title>Geomorphology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geomorphology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Ground-penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Landforms</keyword><keyword>Subsurface characterization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0169555X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2010.09.005</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper presents an overview of the strengths and limitations of existing and emerging geophysical tools for landform studies. The objectives are to discuss recent technical developments and to provide a review of relevant recent literature, with a focus on propagating field methods with terrestrial applications. For various methods in this category, including ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity (ER), seismics, and electromagnetic (EM) induction, the technical backgrounds are introduced, followed by section on novel developments relevant to landform characterization. For several decades, GPR has been popular for characterization of the shallow subsurface and in particular sedimentary systems. Novel developments in GPR include the use of multi-offset systems to improve signal-to-noise ratios and data collection efficiency, amongst others, and the increased use of 3D data. Multi-electrode ER systems have become popular in recent years as they allow for relatively fast and detailed mapping. Novel developments include time-lapse monitoring of dynamic processes as well as the use of capacitively-coupled systems for fast, non-invasive surveys. EM induction methods are especially popular for fast mapping of spatial variation, but can also be used to obtain information on the vertical variation in subsurface electrical conductivity. In recent years several examples of the use of plane wave EM for characterization of landforms have been published. Seismic methods for landform characterization include seismic reflection and refraction techniques and the use of surface waves. A recent development is the use of passive sensing approaches. The use of multiple geophysical methods, which can benefit from the sensitivity to different subsurface parameters, is becoming more common. Strategies for coupled and joint inversion of complementary datasets will, once more widely available, benefit the geophysical study of landforms.Three cases studies are presented on the use of electrical and GPR methods for characterization of landforms in the range of meters to 100. s of meters in dimension. In a study of polygonal patterned ground in the Saginaw Lowlands, Michigan, USA, electrical resistivity tomography was used to characterize differences in subsurface texture and water content associated with polygon-swale topography. Also, a sand-filled thermokarst feature was identified using electrical resistivity data. The second example is on the use of constant spread traversing (CST) for characterization of large-scale glaciotectonic deformation in the Ludington Ridge, Michigan. Multiple CST surveys parallel to an ~. 60. m high cliff, where broad (~. 100. m) synclines and narrow clay-rich anticlines are visible, illustrated that at least one of the narrow structures extended inland. A third case study discusses internal structures of an eolian dune on a coastal spit in New Zealand. Both 35 and 200. MHz GPR data, which clearly identified a paleosol and internal sedimentary structures of the dune, were used to improve understanding of the development of the dune, which may shed light on paleo-wind directions. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bertrand, G.</author><author>Siergieiev, D.</author><author>Ala-Aho, P.</author><author>Rossi, P.

Under- standing these processes is vital in the protection of groundwater-dependent ecosystems increasingly required in water resources legislation across the world. The use of environmental tracers and indicators that are relevant simultaneously for groundwater, surface water and biocenoses–biotope interactions constitutes a powerful tool to succeed in the management task. However, tracer type must be chosen according to the scale of interest and tracer use thus requires a good conceptual understanding of the processes to be evaluated. This paper reviews various GW– SW interaction processes and their drivers and, based on available knowledge, systemises application of conservative tracers and semi-conservative and reactive environ- mental indicators at different spatial scales. Biocenoses–biotopes relationships are viewed as a possible transition tool between scales. Relation between principal application of the environmental tracers and indicators, examples and guidelines are further proposed for examining GW–SW interactions from a hydrogeological and biological point of view by demonstrating the usability of the tracers/indicators and providing recommendations for the scientific community and decision makers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Denchik, Nataliya</author><author>Pezard, Philippe A.</author><author>Neyens, Denis</author><author>Lofi, Johanna</author><author>Gal, Fr??d??rick</author><author>Girard, Jean Fran??ois</author><author>Levannier, Arnaud</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Near-surface CO2 leak detection monitoring from downhole electrical resistivity at the CO2 Field Laboratory, Svelvik Ridge (Norway)</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Downhole monitoring</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>Leakage detection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1750-5836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijggc.2014.06.033</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The objective of the CO2FieldLab project was to demonstrate that adequate monitoring methods can be deployed to document potential leaks of CO2 from subsurface reservoirs. For this, a shallow injection experiment through permeable sediment was designed and conducted at Svelvik (Norway) in September 2011. The goal was to produce a CO2 leak in order to assess the relative sensitivity of several geochemical and geophysical CO2 monitoring tools. A total mass of 1.67tons of CO2 was injected at a depth of 20m through a 45?? inclined well over a 6 day period. Time-lapse induction logging and downhole resistivity monitoring from a permanent dipole-dipole array observatory prove to be very sensitive to the presence of CO2 in the shallow subsurface after the start of injection. Electrical resistivity response correlates with progressive CO2 dissolution in groundwater, with resistivity and pH values decreasing due to the increase of bicarbonate and dissolved species. The CO2 plume is channelled by enhanced permeability layers, with updip migration of the gas plume to the North. Other processes responsible for resistivity changes were fresh/salt water mixing, tidal effects and rainfall. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuras, Oliver</author><author>Wilkinson, Paul B.</author><author>Meldrum, Philip I.</author><author>Oxby, Lucy S.</author><author>Uhlemann, Sebastian</author><author>Chambers, Jonathan E.</author><author>Binley, Andrew</author><author>Graham, James</author><author>Smith, Nicholas T.</author><author>Atherton, Nick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geoelectrical monitoring of simulated subsurface leakage to support high-hazard nuclear decommissioning at the Sellafield Site, UK</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Contaminant transport</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>9789462820272</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.04.212</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A full-scale field experiment applying 4D (3D time-lapse) cross-borehole Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to the monitoring of simulated subsurface leakage was undertaken at a legacy nuclear waste silo at the Sellafield Site, UK.

Secure disposal or storage of nuclear waste within stable geologic environments hinges on the effectiveness of artificial and natural radiation barriers. Fractures in the bedrock are viewed as the most likely passage for the transport of radioactive waste away from a disposal site. We utilize ground penetrating radar (GPR) to map fractures in the tunnel walls of an underground research tunnel at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI). GPR experiments within the KAERI Underground Research Tunnel (KURT) were carried out by using 200 MHz, 500 MHz, and 1000 MHz antennas. By using the high-frequency antennas, we were able to identify small-scale fractures, which were previously unidentified during the tunnel excavation process. Then, through 3-D visualization of the grid survey data, we reconstructed the spatial distribution and interconnectivity of the multi-scale fractures within the wall. We found that a multi-frequency GPR approach provided more details of the complex fracture network, including deep structures. Furthermore, temporal changes in reflection polarity between the GPR surveys enabled us to infer the hydraulic characteristics of the discrete fracture network developed behind the surveyed wall. We hypothesized that the fractures exhibiting polarity change may be due to a combination of air-filled and mineralogical boundaries. Simulated GPR scans for the considered case were consistent with the observed GPR data. If our assumption is correct, the groundwater flow into these near-surface fractures may form the water-filled fractures along the existing air-filled ones and hence cause the changes in reflection polarity over the given time interval (i.e., 7 days). Our results show that the GPR survey is an efficient tool to determine fractures at various scales. Time-lapse GPR data may be essential to characterize the hydraulic behavior of discrete fracture networks in underground disposal facilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cardarelli, Ettore</author><author>De Donno, Giorgio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multidimensional electrical resistivity survey for bedrock detection at the Rieti Plain (Central Italy)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>77-87</pages><volume>141</volume><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Inversion</keyword><keyword>Model appraisal</keyword><keyword>Rieti Plain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.04.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306152</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The combined use of 1D, 2D and 3D electrical resistivity methods for estimating bedrock depth is presented with an application to a case study located in Central Italy. The site is a narrow basin where two boreholes were drilled reaching the bedrock, which had the greatest depth in the center of the basin. Six vertical electrical soundings were executed along a basin cross-section in order to have a preliminary 1D reconstruction of the bedrock and the overlying alluvial deposits. Inverted resistivity models, show bedrock depths in accordance with the borehole data and a complex subsurface layering of the overburden deposits to be further investigated with 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography.

Four additional electrical lines, acquired using a pole-dipole array and directed normally to the alignment of the vertical soundings, confirm the 1D results in regards to the bedrock depths, adding additional information about the continuity of the bedrock within the basin, and giving a high resolution image of the shallower sediments. Through the tomographic inversion of 3D data we were able to reconstruct a volumetric image of the carbonate formation at the study site.

Finally, the tomographic models have been validated through the inversion of a synthetic dataset, with the aim to attain a final model, whose synthetic model is comparable with the field one. The final model, estimated using an iterative procedure that minimises the absolute difference between field and synthetic models, has retrieved a bedrock resistivity one order of magnitude higher than that obtained from field data inversion.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cassidy, Nigel J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating LNAPL contamination using GPR signal attenuation analysis and dielectric property measurements: Practical implications for hydrological studies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Attenuation</keyword><keyword>Attribute analysis</keyword><keyword>Dielectric</keyword><keyword>Ground penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>LNAPL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0169-7722</isbn><accession-num>17601633</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2007.05.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Groundwater and sub-surface contamination by Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (LNAPLs) is one of the industrial world's most pressing environmental issues and a thorough understanding of the hydrological, physical and bio-chemical properties of the sub-surface is key to determining the spatial and temporal development of any particular contamination event. Non-invasive geophysical techniques (such as electrical resistivity, electromagnetic conductivity, Ground-Penetrating Radar, etc.) have proved to be successful sub-surface investigation and characterisation tools with Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) being particularly popular. Recent studies have shown that the spatial/temporal variation in GPR signal attenuation can provide important information on the electrical properties of the sub-surface materials that, in turn, can be used to assess the physical and hydrological nature of the pore fluids and associated contaminants. Unfortunately, a high percentage of current LNAPL-related GPR studies focus on contaminant mapping only, with little emphasis being placed on characterising the hydrological properties (e.g., determining contaminant saturation index, etc.). By comparing laboratory-based, dielectric measurements of LNAPL contaminated materials with the GPR signal attenuation observed in both contaminated and 'clean' areas of an LNAPL contaminated site, new insights have been gained into the nature of contaminant distribution/saturation and the likely signal attenuation mechanisms. The results show that, despite some practical limitations of the analysis technique, meaningful hydrological interpretations can be obtained on the contaminant properties, saturation index and bio-degradation processes. A generalised attenuation/saturation model has been developed that describes the physical and attenuation enhancement characteristics of the contaminated areas and reveals that the most significant attenuation is related to smeared zone surrounding the seasonally changing water table interface. It is envisaged that the model will provide a basis for the interpretation of GPR data from analogous LNAPL contaminated sites and provide investigators with an appreciation of the merits and limitations of GPR-based, attenuation analysis techniques for hydrological applications. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The 3D model was created using the GSI3D software package and the geophysical techniques used included ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and automated resistivity profiling. In addition, the remote sensing techniques of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and airborne thematic mapping (ATM) were used. The objective of the study was to assess the contribution of these techniques to improve the geological mapping and interpretation of terrace deposits and other geological features. The study site had an area of ~2 km2 and consisted of a Triassic mudstone escarpment, overlain first by a sand and gravel river terrace that extended to the modern floodplain of the River Trent. Automated resistivity profiling mapping proved to be the central tool in identifying and positioning geological features at a greater resolution than would be obtained through traditional geological mapping and borehole observation. These features included i) a buried cliff delineating the south-eastern limits of the incised Trent valley, ii) siltstone beds within the Gunthorpe Member of the Mercia Mudstone Group and iii) the variability of the sediments within the river terrace. A long ERT transect across the site successfully imaged the buried cliff and outcropping siltstone beds on the escarpment. Combined ERT and GPR transects revealed the depth of the sand and gravel deposits (Holme Pierrepont sands and gravels), whilst the GPR provided information about the depositional environment. Remote sensing using light detection and ranging proved essential in the original geological survey because it confirmed the absence of a second river terrace that had been previously thought to exist. This case study demonstrates the importance of combining geophysical techniques with traditional geological survey and borehole analysis, in order to create high-resolution 3D geological models, which are increasingly being used as a platform to understand and solve environmental problems.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, J.

Discrete intrusive sampling using conventional approaches provides insufficient sample density and can be difficult to deploy on soft ground. Here a noninvasive geophysical imaging approach combining three-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and the novel application of gradient and isosurface-based edge detectors is considered as a means of illuminating wetland deposit architecture. The performance of three edge detectors were compared and evaluated against ground truth data, using a lowland riparian wetland demonstration site. Isosurface-based methods correlated well with intrusive data and were useful for defining the geometries of key geological interfaces (i.e., peat/gravels and gravels/ Chalk). The use of gradient detectors approach was unsuccessful, indicating that the assumption that the steepest resistivity gradient coincides with the associated geological interface can be incorrect. These findings are relevant to the application of this approach in settings with a broadly layered geology with strata of contrasting resistivities. In addition, ERT revealed substantial structures in the gravels related to the depositional environment (i.e., braided fluvial system) and a complex distribution of low-permeability putty Chalk at the bedrock surface—with implications for preferential flow and variable exchange between river and groundwater systems. These results demonstrate that a combined approach using ERT and edge detectors can provide valuable information to support targeted monitoring and inform hydrological modeling of wetlands</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, J.

We illustrate the method through an analysis of terrace deposits of the Great Ouse River (UK), where up to 4. m of sand and gravel have filled the valley bottom during the latest Pleistocene. We use an edge detector to identify the steepest gradient in first-derivative resistivity profiles, which yields an estimate of bedrock depth (verified by drilling) to a precision better than 0.2. m (average) and 0.4. m (standard deviation). Comparison of a range of drilling techniques at the site has revealed that borehole derived interface depths suffered from levels of uncertainty similar to those associated with the 3D ERT - indicating that the reliability of bedrock interface depths determined using these two approaches is comparable in this case. The 3D ERT method provides a high spatial resolution that enabled a previously unknown erosional bedrock structure, associated with the change from deeper first terrace to second terrace deposits, to be identified in the Great Ouse valley. The method provides a relatively quick method to quantify terrace fill volume over large sites to a greater degree of precision than currently available. ?? 2012 Natural Environment Research Council.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwartz, N.</author><author>Furman, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral induced polarization signature of soil contaminated by organic pollutant: Experiment and modeling</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>2156-2202</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2012JB009543</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The spectral induced polarization (SIP) signature of soil contaminated with organic pollutant was studied. Using a flow column experiment, the effect of crystal violet (CV, a polar organic pollutant) on the temporal change of the SIP response over a broad frequency range (1 mHz to 45 KHz) was determined. Complimentary measurements were used to determine the effect of CV on the chemical composition of both the pore water and the solid surface. In addition, analysis of the experimental results was carried out by using both chemical complexation and induced polarization models. Our results shows that adsorption of CV to the mineral surface resulted in release of inorganic ions to the soil solution, increasing the solution electrical conductivity and therefore also the real part of the complex conductivity. Despite the increase in the real part of the complex conductivity, the imaginary part of the complex conductivity decreased with increasing concentration of adsorbed CV. Using the Revil induced polarization model, we were able to show that the contribution of the adsorbed CV to the polarization of the soil is negligible, and that the main process affecting the polarization is the decrease in the density of the inorganic surface species. The results of this study can be used to better interpret SIP signature of soils contaminated by organic compounds. © 2012. American Geophysical Union.

A shallow hydrothermal system was exposed to the surface of the new crater floor and is characterized by an acid crater lake, a geyser-like Cl-rich spring (soap pool), and numerous fumarole fields. Multiple geophysical surveys were performed to define the internal structure of the volcanic edifice and its hydrothermal system. We carried out a high-resolution ground-based geomagnetic survey in the 1982 crater and its surroundings and 38 very low frequency (VLF) transects around the crater lake. A 3-D inversion of the ground-based magnetic data set highlighted three high-susceptibility isosurfaces, interpreted as highly magnetized bodies beneath the 1982 crater floor. Inversion of a digitized regional aeromagnetic map highlighted four major deeply rooted cryptodomes, corresponding to major topographic highs and massive lava dome outcrops outside and on the somma rim. The intracrater magnetic bodies correspond closely to the active hydrothermal vents and their modeled maximum basal depth matches the elevation of the springs on the flanks of the volcano. Position, dip, and vertical extent of active and extinct hydrothermal vents identified by VLF-EM surveys match the magnetic data set. We interpret the shallow lake spring hydrothermal system to be mostly associated with buried remnants of the 550 BP dome, but the Cl-rich soap pool may be connected to a small intrusion emplaced at shallow depth during the 1982 eruption.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carrigan, Charles R.</author><author>Yang, Xianjin</author><author>LaBrecque, Douglas J.</author><author>Larsen, Dennis</author><author>Freeman, David</author><author>Ramirez, Abelardo L.</author><author>Daily, William</author><author>Aines, Roger</author><author>Newmark, Robin</author><author>Friedmann, Julio</author><author>Hovorka, Susan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical resistance tomographic monitoring of CO2 movement in deep geologic reservoirs</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</full-title></periodical><volume>18</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1750-5836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.04.016</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Deep geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is being evaluated internationally to mitigate the impact of greenhouse gases produced during oil- and coal-based energy generation and manufacturing. Natural gas producing fields are particularly attractive sites for sequestration activities owing to the assumption that the same geologic barrier or cap rock permitting the subsurface regime to act as a long term natural gas reservoir will also serve to permanently contain the injected supercritical CO2. Electrical resistance tomography (ERT) can potentially track the movement and concentration of the injectate as well as the degree of geologic containment using time lapse electrical resistivity changes resulting from injecting the super-critical fluid into the reservoir formation. An experimental cross-well ERT system operated successfully for more than one year obtaining time lapse electrical resistivity images during the injection of approximately one-million tons of CO2 at a depth exceeding 3000m in an oil and gas field in Cranfield, MS, representing the deepest application of the method to date. When converted to CO2 saturation, the resultant images provide information about the movement of the injected CO2 within a complex geologic formation and the development of the saturation distribution with time. ERT demonstrated significant potential for near real-time assessment of the degree of geologic containment and for updating risk analyses of the sequestration process. Furthermore, electrical resistivity imaging of the developing CO2 distribution may provide crucial input about the developing reservoir pressure field that is required for active reservoir management to prevent the occurrence of cap-rock-damaging seismic activity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bedrosian, Paul A.</author><author>Schamper, Cyril</author><author>Auken, Esben</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of helicopter-borne electromagnetic systems for hydrogeologic studies</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Prospecting</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Prospecting</full-title></periodical><volume>64</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1365-2478.12262</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The increased application of airborne electromagnetic surveys to hydrogeological studies is driving a demand for data that can consistently be inverted for accurate subsurface resistivity structure from the near surface to depths of several hundred metres.We present an evaluation of three commercial airborne electromagnetic systems over two test blocks in westernNebraska, USA.

The near surface (0-40. m depth range) electrical resistivity distribution of these anomalies appeared to be coincident with superficial features related to surface water such as alluvial fans and flood plains. This paper describes the application of transient electromagnetic soundings (TEM) and continuous vertical electrical sounding (CVES) using geo-electrics and time domain induced polarisation to evaluate a freshwater lens across a flood plain on the northern bank of the Zambezi River at Kasaya in south western Zambia. Coincident TEM and CVES measurements were conducted across the Simalaha Plain from the edge of the Zambezi River up to 6.6 km inland. The resulting TEM, direct current and induced polarisation data sets were inverted using a new mutually and laterally constrained joint inversion scheme. The resulting inverse model sections depict a freshwater lens sitting on top of a regional saline aquifer. The fresh water lens is about 60 m thick at the boundary with the Zambezi River and gradually thins out and deteriorates in water quality further inland. It is postulated that the freshwater lens originated as a result of interaction between the Zambezi River and the salty aquifer in a setting in which evapotranspiration is the net climatic stress. Similar high electrical resistivity bodies were also associated with other surface water features located in the airborne surveyed area.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Høyer, A.

Delineation of the structures and modelling of the infill is therefore very important in relation to groundwater mapping. Typically, borehole information is too sparse to enable a detailed delineation of the structures, whereas densely covering airborne electromagnetic data have proven to be very useful for this. In the last decades, the mapping approach has been studied carefully, but the 3D modelling of the valley structures has not been described to the same degree yet. In this study, we create a 3D geological model of an area that is characterised by a complex network of buried valleys mapped with a spatially dense airborne electromagnetic survey. Due to the comprehensive dataset, the modelling requires formulation of an advanced strategy. This contains a number of steps, where the AEM-derived resistivity data are initially interpreted based on the geological background knowledge to identify the buried valleys and build a conceptual geological model. Secondly, the age relationships between the valleys are established from the valley orientations and their internal cross-cut relationships. Thirdly, the deep erosional surfaces are modelled. Subsequently, the interpreted age relationships are utilised to trim the valley floor surfaces, such that younger valleys cut older. Finally, a voxel model is built and populated with lithofacies and stratigraphical units. The model is constructed as a combined layer-based and voxel model in order to map both the overall structures as well as the lithological variations within the 3D model domain. The final model contains 20 buried valleys that show a complex cross-cut setting that indicate the presence of at least eight valley generations. Most of the valley infills show lithological variations, and the final voxel model thus contains 42 different geological units.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cassiani, G.</author><author>Boaga, J.</author><author>Vanella, D.</author><author>Perri, M.

The understanding of these exchanges also play a critical role for practical purposes e.g. in precision agriculture. In this paper we present a methodology based on coupling innovative data collection and models in order to obtain quantitative estimates of the key parameters of such complex flow system. In particular we propose the use of hydro-geophysical monitoring via &quot;time-lapse&quot; electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in conjunction with measurements of plant transpiration via sap flow and evapotranspiration (ET) from eddy covariance (EC). This abundance of data is fed to spatially distributed soil models in order to characterize the distribution of active roots. We conducted experiments in an orange orchard in eastern Sicily (Italy), characterized by the typical Mediterranean semi-arid climate. The subsoil dynamics, particularly influenced by irrigation and root uptake, were characterized mainly by the ERT set-up, consisting of 48 buried electrodes on 4 instrumented micro-boreholes (about 1.2 m deep) placed at the corners of a square (with about 1.3 m long sides) surrounding the orange tree, plus 24 mini-electrodes on the surface spaced 0.1 m on a square grid. During the monitoring, we collected repeated ERT and time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture measurements, soil water sampling, sap flow measurements from the orange tree and EC data. We conducted a laboratory calibration of the soil electrical properties as a function of moisture content and porewater electrical conductivity. Irrigation, precipitation, sap flow and ET data are available allowing for knowledge of the system's long-term forcing conditions on the system. This information was used to calibrate a 1-D Richards' equation model representing the dynamics of the volume monitored via 3-D ERT. Information on the soil hydraulic properties was collected from laboratory and field experiments. The successful results of the calibrated modelling exercise allow for the quantification of the soil volume interested by root water uptake (RWU). This volume is much smaller (with a surface area less than 2 m2, and about 40 cm thick) than expected and assumed in the design of classical drip irrigation schemes that prove to be losing at least half of the irrigated water which is not taken up by the plants.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, J.

The present study was carried out to test the use of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to estimate the daily variations in the volumetric moisture content (VMC) during waste degradation. The degradation of MSW in a laboratory-scale reactor was monitored daily by ERT and time domain reflectometry (TDR) over a period of 55 days after the waste was landfilled. The bulk electrical resistivity, normalised to a standard temperature of 25 °C, was compared to the VMC obtained by TDR. The relationship between the bulk electrical resistivity and the VMC was not obvious in the upper unit, because there was a bias in the positions of the ERT and TDR measurements due to the settling of the waste. However, the bulk electrical resistivity depended on the VMC in the lower unit of the reactor. According to a power equation fitted in the lower unit, the 2-D distributions of the VMC are presented. Variations in the VMC reflected the processes of waste degradation and leachate transportation. Furthermore, the volume of water stored in the lower unit of the reactor was calculated and found to be consistent with that estimated from the gravimetric moisture content during waste sampling. The data showed that ERT could be used to estimate the variations in moisture content in the initial period following the landfilling of waste. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tallini, Marco</author><author>Gasbarri, Diego</author><author>Ranalli, Danilo</author><author>Scozzafava, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating epikarst using low-frequency GPR: Example from the Gran Sasso range (Central Italy)</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Central Italy</keyword><keyword>Epikarst</keyword><keyword>Ground penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Groundwater flow path</keyword><keyword>Karstaquifer vulnerability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1435-9529</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10064-005-0017-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tallini et al. - 2006 - Investigating epikarst using low-frequency GPR Example from the Gran Sasso range (Central Italy).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A realistic 3D view of the epikarst is key to understanding karst groundwater phenomena.

Soil moisture is an important control on hydrologic function, as it governs vertical fluxes from and to the atmosphere, groundwater recharge, and lateral fluxes through the soil. Historically, the traditional model parameters of saturation, field capacity, and permanent wilting point have been determined by laboratory methods. This approach is challenged by issues of scale, boundary conditions, and soil disturbance. We develop and compare four methods to determine values of field saturation, field capacity, plant extraction limit (PEL), and initiation of plant water stress from long term in-situ monitoring records of TDR-measured volumetric water content (The monitoring sites represent a range of soil textures, soil depths, effective precipitation and plant cover types in a semi-arid climate. The records exhibit attractors (high frequency values) that correspond to field capacity and the PEL at both annual and longer time scales, but the field saturation values vary by year depending on seasonal wetness in the semi-arid setting. The analysis for five sites in two watersheds is supported by comparison to values determined by a common pedotransfer function and measured soil characteristic curves. Frozen soil is identified as a complicating factor for the analysis and users are cautioned to filter data by temperature, especially for near surface soils.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tallini, Marco</author><author>Gasbarri, Diego</author><author>Ranalli, Danilo</author><author>Scozzafava, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating epikarst using low-frequency GPR: Example from the Gran Sasso range (Central Italy)</title><secondary-title>Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Central Italy</keyword><keyword>Epikarst</keyword><keyword>Ground penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Groundwater flow path</keyword><keyword>Karstaquifer vulnerability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1435-9529</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10064-005-0017-y</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Tallini et al. - 2006 - Investigating epikarst using low-frequency GPR Example from the Gran Sasso range (Central Italy).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A realistic 3D view of the epikarst is key to understanding karst groundwater phenomena.

The radar signal interpretation was correlated with field observations of the epikarst and borehole data. Two radar anomaly surfaces were identified, which were correlated with the top and bottom of the epikarst surface. The shape of the two surfaces correlates well with the surface topography of the study sinkhole and with the orientation of its main joints and karren. The work indicated that such a 3D reconstruction could be usefully applied to karst aquifer vulnerability studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aharoni, Imri</author><author>Siebner, Hagar</author><author>Dahan, Ofer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of vadose-zone monitoring system for real-time characterization of leachate percolation in and under a municipal landfill</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>Groundwater</keyword><keyword>Leachate generation</keyword><keyword>Municipal landfill</keyword><keyword>Pollutant attenuation</keyword><keyword>Vadose zone monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.wasman.2017.05.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Aharoni, Siebner, Dahan - 2017 - Application of vadose-zone monitoring system for real-time characterization of leachate percolation in.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>a b s t r a c t Leachates from solid-waste landfills are considered a severe threat to groundwater quality. The fate of pollutants in the waste and underlying unsaturated zone is crucial for evaluating environmental risks and selecting a restoration strategy. In this study, a vadose-zone monitoring system (VMS) installed in a municipal landfill was used, for the first time, to continuously track leachates percolation dynamics and assess their chemical transformation across the entire thickness of the waste body (15 m) and under-lying unsaturated zone (16 m) to the water table. Winter rains were found to quickly infiltrate through the waste and underlying vadose zone despite a clay cover that was implemented as part of a restoration and leachate-prevention strategy. Within the waste body, the flow pattern was controlled by preferential flow paths, which changed frequently. It is hypothesized that ongoing decomposition of the waste creates dynamic variations in the waste's physical structure and flow pattern. Water samples collected from the waste layer indicated the formation of highly polluted leachates. The chemical composition in the waste body showed extreme variability between sampling points with respect to DOC (407–31,464 mg/L), BOD/ COD ratios (0.07–0.55), Fe 2+ (6.8–1154 mg/L), ammonium (68–2924 mg/L) and heavy metal concentra-tions. Environmental hot spots creating concentrated, aggressive, ''acid-phase &quot; leachates still exist in the waste more than 13 years after closing the landfill. However, continuous changes in the flow pattern and moisture distribution affected the creation and decay of such environments. In the underlying sandy vadose zone, some sections repeatedly exhibited stronger and faster flow characteristics than others. These local fluxes of concentrated leachates rapidly transported heavy contaminant loads toward the groundwater. However results showed evidence of continual attenuation processes in the deep vadose zone, with the anaerobic digestion of organic matter, as well as the significant retention of heavy metals.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caterina, David</author><author>Flores Orozco, Adrian</author><author>Nguyen, Frédéric</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term ERT monitoring of biogeochemical changes of an aged hydrocarbon contamination</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.04.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Caterina, Flores Orozco, Nguyen - 2017 - Long-term ERT monitoring of biogeochemical changes of an aged hydrocarbon contamination.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A B S T R A C T Adequate management of contaminated sites requires information with improved spatio-temporal resolution, in particular to assess bio-geochemical processes, such as the transformation and degradation of contaminants, precipitation of minerals or changes in groundwater geochemistry occurring during and after remediation procedures. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), a geophysical method sensitive to pore-fluid and pore-geometry properties, permits to gain quasi-continuous information about subsurface properties in real-time and has been consequently widely used for the characterization of hydrocarbon-impacted sediments. However, its application for the long-term monitoring of processes accompanying natural or engineered bioremediation is still difficult due to the poor understanding of the role that biogeochemical processes play in the electrical signatures. For in-situ studies, the task is further complicated by the variable signal-to-noise ratio and the variations of environmental parameters leading to resolution changes in the electrical images. In this work, we present ERT imaging results for data collected over a period of two years on a site affected by a diesel fuel contamination and undergoing bioremediation. We report low electrical resistivity anomalies in areas associated to the highest contaminant concentrations likely due transformations of the contaminant due to microbial activity and accompanying release of metabolic products. We also report large seasonal variations of the bulk electrical resistivity in the contaminated areas in correlation with temperature and groundwater level fluctuations. However, the amplitude of bulk electrical resistivity variations largely exceeds the amplitude expected given existing petrophysical models. Our results suggest that the variations in electrical properties are mainly controlled by microbial activity which in turn depends on soil temperature and hydrogeological conditions. Therefore, ERT can be suggested as a promising tool to track microbial activity during bioremediation even though further research is still needed to completely understand the bio-geochemical processes involved and their impact on electrical signatures.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mosquera, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-Resolution Geophysical Characterization of an Ethanol Release into an Existing Gasoline-Impacted Zone</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mosquera - Unknown - High-Resolution Geophysical Characterization of an Ethanol Release into an Existing Gasoline-Impacted Zone.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gonçalves, Eduardo Corrêa</author><author>da Silva, Pablo Nascimento</author><author>Silveira, Carla Semiramis</author><author>Carneiro, Giovanna</author><author>Domingues, Ana Beatriz</author><author>Moss, Adam</author><author>Pritchard, Tim</author><author>Plastino, Alexandre</author><author>Azeredo, Rodrigo Bagueira de Vasconcellos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of carbonate rock type from NMR responses using data mining techniques</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>93-101</pages><volume>140</volume><keywords><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Data mining</keyword><keyword>Nuclear magnetic resonance</keyword><keyword>Rock typing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.03.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116303937</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Recent studies have indicated that the accurate identification of carbonate rock types in a reservoir can be employed as a preliminary step to enhance the effectiveness of petrophysical property modeling. Furthermore, rock typing activity has been shown to be of key importance in several steps of formation evaluation, such as the study of sedimentary series, reservoir zonation and well-to-well correlation. In this paper, a methodology based exclusively on the analysis of 1H-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) relaxation responses – using data mining algorithms – is evaluated to perform the automatic classification of carbonate samples according to their rock type. We analyze the effectiveness of six different classification algorithms (k-NN, Naïve Bayes, C4.5, Random Forest, SMO and Multilayer Perceptron) and two data preprocessing strategies (discretization and feature selection). The dataset used in this evaluation is formed by 78 1H-NMR T2 distributions of fully brine-saturated rock samples from six different rock type classes. The experiments reveal that the combination of preprocessing strategies with classification algorithms is able to achieve a prediction accuracy of 97.4%.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dai, Qianwei</author><author>Lin, Fangpeng</author><author>Wang, Xiaoping</author><author>Feng, Deshan</author><author>Bayless, Richard C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection of concrete dam leakage using an integrated geophysical technique based on flow-field fitting method</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>168-176</pages><volume>140</volume><keywords><keyword>Concrete dam</keyword><keyword>Flow-field fitting method</keyword><keyword>Leakage detection</keyword><keyword>Limitations and complements to flow-field fitting</keyword><keyword>Resistivity logging method</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.03.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117303014</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
An integrated geophysical investigation was performed at S dam located at Dadu basin in China to assess the condition of the dam curtain. The key methodology of the integrated technique used was flow-field fitting method, which allowed identification of the hydraulic connections between the dam foundation and surface water sources (upstream and downstream), and location of the anomalous leakage outlets in the dam foundation. Limitations of the flow-field fitting method were complemented with resistivity logging to identify the internal erosion which had not yet developed into seepage pathways. The results of the flow-field fitting method and resistivity logging were consistent when compared with data provided by seismic tomography, borehole television, water injection test, and rock quality designation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guerrero, Massimo</author><author>Rüther, Nils</author><author>Haun, Stefan</author><author>Baranya, Sandor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A combined use of acoustic and optical devices to investigate suspende d se diment in rivers</title><secondary-title>Advances in Water Resources</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Water Resources</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>102</volume><keywords><keyword>ADCP</keyword><keyword>Acoustic attenuation</keyword><keyword>Backscatter</keyword><keyword>LISST-SL</keyword><keyword>Optical attenuation</keyword><keyword>Particle size distribution</keyword><keyword>Rivers</keyword><keyword>Suspended sediment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.01.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Guerrero et al. - 2017 - A combined use of acoustic and optical devices to investigate suspende d se diment in rivers.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>a b s t r a c t The use of acoustic and optic devices has become more and more common for estimating suspended sed-iment loads in rivers. The echo intensity levels (EIL) recorded by means of an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) have been applied in different methods, which provided relationships between scattering particles features derived from samples (i.e., concentration and grain size) and corresponding backscatter-ing strength and sound attenuation. At the same time, the laser diffraction was applied by an in-stream sampler (LISST-SL) to measure suspended sediment concentration and the corresponding particle size dis-tribution (PSD). These two techniques exhibited different limitations in terms of the measured range of concentration, sensitivity to a certain spectrum of particle sizes, and instruments deploy feasibility espe-cially in large rivers, in a way that the use of sampled PSD by LISST-SL to validate ADCP methods may not be trivial. The aim of this study was to combine the vertical profiling of EIL by an ADCP with results from LISST-SL, eventually demonstrating the possibility of using moving ADCP measurements to detect differ-ent suspended matters along a Danube River section characterized by a small tributary junction. At the same time, this work elucidates optical to acoustic method deviations that hinders an actual validation of ADCP methods based on LISST-SL rather than with physical samplings.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Placencia-Gómez, Edmundo</author><author>Parviainen, Annika</author><author>Slater, Lee</author><author>Leveinen, Jussi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral induced polarization (SIP) response of mine tailings</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><volume>173</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0169-7722</isbn><accession-num>25528133</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2014.12.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Mine tailings impoundments are a source of leachates known as acid mine drainage (AMD) which can pose a contamination risk for surrounding surface and groundwater. Methodologies which can help management of this environmental issue are needed. We carried out a laboratory study of the spectral induced polarization (SIP) response of tailings from the Haveri Au-Cu mine, SW Finland. The primary objectives were, (1) to determine possible correlations between SIP parameters and textural properties associated with oxidative-weathering mechanisms, mineralogical composition and metallic content, and (2) to evaluate the effects of the pore water chemistry on SIP parameters associated with redox-inactive and redox-active electrolytes varying in molar concentration, conductivity and pH. The Haveri tailings exhibit well defined relaxation spectra between 100 and 10,000 Hz. The relaxation magnitudes are governed by the in-situ oxidative-weathering conditions on sulphide mineral surfaces contained in the tailings, and decrease with the oxidation degree. The oxidation-driven textural variation in the tailings results in changes to the frequency peak of the phase angle, the imaginary conductivity and chargeability, when plotted versus the pore water conductivity. In contrast, the real and the formation electrical conductivity components show a single linear dependence on the pore water conductivity. The increase of the pore water conductivity (dominated by the increase of ions concentration in solution) along with a transition to acidic conditions shifts the polarization peak towards higher frequencies. These findings show the unique sensitivity of the SIP method to potentially discriminate AMD discharges from reactive oxidation zones in tailings, suggesting a significant advantage for monitoring threatened aquifers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mary, Benjamin</author><author>Saracco, Ginette</author><author>Peyras, Laurent</author><author>Vennetier, Michel</author><author>Mériaux, Patrice</author><author>Camerlynck, Christian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping tree root system in dikes using induced polarization: Focus on the influence of soil water content</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.05.005</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In this study, we assessed induced polarization as potential non-destructive method for root detection in dike embankments. We used both laboratory and field experiment to describe the electrical signal with a focus on soil water content. Our objective was to determine in which hydric state of the soil, and related electrical properties, roots could be accurately discriminated. We hypothesized that preferential water zone absorption near the roots could, in some conditions, contribute to locate them. During the laboratory experiments, we compared the response of containers filled with the same homogeneous silty clay bare material, and without (A) or with freshly cut root (B) at different levels of soil water content. Resistivity and phase variations with soil water content indicated that it was preferable to work in dry conditions since the contrast was higher. Interactions and overlapping between polarization effects of both root and soil made it difficult to interpret first chargeability maps. This led us to study temporal-spatial variations by considering the dynamics of water absorption during a field experiment. High resolution time lapses images showed a correlation between root location and complex resistivity anomalies. Although these first results have to be confirmed by further measurements, induced polarization seems to add useful information to interpret anomalies produced by woody roots.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ling, Chengpeng</author><author>Xu, Qiang</author><author>Zhang, Qiang</author><author>Ran, Jiaxin</author><author>Lv, Hongbin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of electrical resistivity tomography for investigating the internal structure of a translational landslide and characterizing its groundwater circulation (Kualiangzi landslide, Southwest China)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><volume>131</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.06.003</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a widely used tool in near surface geophysical surveys for the investigation of various geological and engineering problems, including landslides. In this study, the internal structure of the southern region of the Kualiangzi landslide, which is located in Sichuan province, China, was investigated using four ERT profiles, drill cores, and inclinometer data. The characteristics of the groundwater circulation were evaluated from variations in electrical resistivity and groundwater level. The results showed that the sliding surface corresponds to a deep zone with low resistivity and that the sliding material consists of clay, gravelly soil, and weathered sandstone and mudstone. The thickness of the sliding material is 50 m in the main tension trough and decreases to several meters in the direction of sliding. The dip angle of the sliding surface that has low resistivity is generally consistent with that of the bedrock. The groundwater level in the tension trough and in the middle transitional part from hill-country to flat terrain was highest in the landslide. The groundwater level close to the toe front of the landslide was the lowest. The groundwater is recharged by the precipitation and generally drains to the toe front by seasonal springs along the sliding surface. The rapid increment of the groundwater level in the tension trough kept pace with that of the displacement rate after intense rainfall. The improved understanding of internal structure and groundwater recirculation is beneficial for the analysis of the mechanisms of translational landslides and their hazard prevention.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Herckenrath, D.</author><author>Fiandaca, G.</author><author>Auken, E.</author><author>Bauer-Gottwein, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sequential and joint hydrogeophysical inversion using a field-scale groundwater model with ERT and TDEM data</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>17</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-17-4043-2013</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Increasingly, ground-based and airborne geophysical data sets are used to inform groundwater models. Recent research focuses on establishing coupling relationships between geophysical and groundwater parameters. To fully exploit such information, this paper presents and compares different hydrogeophysical inversion approaches to inform a field-scale groundwater model with time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. In a sequential hydrogeophysical inversion (SHI) a groundwater model is calibrated with geophysical data by coupling groundwater model parameters with the inverted geophysical models. We subsequently compare the SHI with a joint hydrogeophysical inversion (JHI). In the JHI, a geophysical model is simultaneously inverted with a groundwater model by coupling the groundwater and geophysical parameters to explicitly account for an established petrophysical relationship and its accuracy. Simulations for a synthetic groundwater model and TDEM data showed improved estimates for groundwater model parameters that were coupled to relatively well-resolved geophysical parameters when employing a high-quality petrophysical relationship. Compared to a SHI these improvements were insignificant and geophysical parameter estimates became slightly worse. When employing a low-quality petrophysical relationship, groundwater model parameters improved less for both the SHI and JHI, where the SHI performed relatively better. When comparing a SHI and JHI for a real-world groundwater model and ERT data, differences in parameter estimates were small. For both cases investigated in this paper, the SHI seems favorable, taking into account parameter error, data fit and the complexity of implementing a JHI in combination with its larger computational burden.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klotzsche, Anja</author><author>Jan van der Kruk</author><author>Niklas Linde</author><author>Joseph Doetsch</author><author>Harry Vereecken</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3-D characterization of high-permeability zones in a gravel aquifer using 2-D crosshole GPR full-waveform inversion and waveguide detection</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><volume>195</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0956-540X 204.%0 Journal Article</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/gji/ggt275</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Reliable high-resolution 3-D characterization of aquifers helps to improve our understanding of flow and transport processes when small-scale structures have a strong influence. Crosshole ground penetrating radar (GPR) is a powerful tool for characterizing aquifers due to the method's high-resolution and sensitivity to porosity and soil water content. Recently, a novel GPR full-waveform inversion algorithm was introduced, which is here applied and used for 3-D characterization by inverting six crosshole GPR cross-sections collected between four wells arranged in a square configuration close to the Thur River in Switzerland. The inversion results in the saturated part of this gravel aquifer reveals a significant improvement in resolution for the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity images compared to ray-based methods. Consistent structures where acquisition planes intersect indicate the robustness of the inversion process. A decimetre-scale layer with high dielectric permittivity was revealed at a depth of 5–6 m in all six cross-sections analysed here, and a less prominent zone with high dielectric permittivity was found at a depth of 7.5–9 m. These high-permittivity layers act as low-velocity waveguides and they are interpreted as high-porosity layers and possible zones of preferential flow. Porosity estimates from the permittivity models agree well with estimates from Neutron–Neutron logging data at the intersecting diagonal planes. Moreover, estimates of hydraulic permeability based on flowmeter logs confirm the presence of zones of preferential flow in these depth intervals. A detailed analysis of the measured data for transmitters located within the waveguides, revealed increased trace energy due to late-arrival elongated wave trains, which were observed for receiver positions straddling this zone. For the same receiver positions within the waveguide, a distinct minimum in the trace energy was visible when the transmitter was located outside the waveguide. A novel amplitude analysis was proposed to explore these maxima and minima of the trace energy. Laterally continuous low-velocity waveguides and their boundaries were identified in the measured data alone. In contrast to the full-waveform inversion, this method follows a simple workflow and needs no detailed and time consuming processing or inversion of the data. Comparison with the full-waveform inversion results confirmed the presence of the waveguides illustrating that full-waveform inversion return reliable results at the highest resolution currently possible at these scales. We envision that full-waveform inversion of GPR data will play an important role in a wide range of geological, hydrological, glacial and periglacial studies in the critical zone. %@ 0956-540X 201.%0 Journal Article</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, Deqiang</author><author>Revil, André</author><author>Hinton, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induced polarization response of porous media with metallic particles — Part 4: Detection of metallic and nonmetallic targets in time-domain-induced polarization tomography</title><secondary-title>Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysics</full-title></periodical><volume>81</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/geo2015-0480.1</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>ABSTRACTTime-domain-induced polarization (TDIP) is a nonintrusive imaging technique of the subsurface that can be used to localize polarizable bodies including metallic objects and clay-rich materials.

Spatially-distributed and high frequency observations of these hydrological processes are important for improving our understanding and prediction of landslide triggering. This work presents observed changes in electrical resistivity monitored at the Super-Sauze clayey landslide with the GEOMON4D resistivity instrument installed permanently on-site for a period of one year. A methodological framework for processing the raw measurement is proposed. It includes the filtering of the resistivity dataset, the correction of the effects of non-hydrological factors (sensitivity of the device, sensitivity to soil temperature and fluid conductivity, presence of fissures in the topsoil) on the filtered resistivity values. The interpretation is based on a statistical analysis to define possible relationships between the rainfall characteristics, the soil hydrological observations and the soil electrical resistivity response. During the monitoring period, no significant relationships between the electrical response and the measured hydrological parameters are evidenced. We discuss the limitations of the method due to the effect of heat exchange between the groundwater, the vadose zone water and the rainwater that hides the variations of resistivity due to variations of the soil water content. We demonstrate that despite the absence of hydrogeophysical information for the vadose zone, the sensitivity of electrical resistivity monitoring to temperature variations allows imaging water fluxes in the saturated zone and highlighting the existence of matrix and preferential flows that does not occur at the same time and for the same duration. We conclude on the necessity to combine electrical resistivity measurements with distributed soil temperature measurements.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slater, L</author><author>Binley, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of permeable reactive barrier (PRB) integrity using electrical imaging methods</title><secondary-title>Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Boreholes</keyword><keyword>Chlorinated organics</keyword><keyword>Dehalogenation</keyword><keyword>Electric conductivity</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Groundwater</keyword><keyword>Hydrocarbons</keyword><keyword>Permeable reactive barriers (PRB)</keyword><keyword>electrical conductivity</keyword><keyword>electromagnetic survey</keyword><keyword>groundwater pollution</keyword><keyword>performance assessment</keyword><keyword>reactive barrier</keyword><keyword>waste treatment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>00168033 (ISSN)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.1581043</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Slater, Binley - 2003 - Evaluation of permeable reactive barrier (PRB) integrity using electrical imaging methods(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is a promising in-situ technology for treatment of hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater. A PRB is typically composed of granular iron which degrades chlorinated organics into potentially nontoxic dehalogenated organic compounds and inorganic chloride. Geophysical methods may assist assessment of in-situ barrier integrity and evaluation of long-term barrier performance. The highly conductive granular iron makes the PRB an excellent target for conductivity imaging methods. In addition, electrochemical storage of charge at the iron-solution interface generates an impedance that decreases with frequency. The PRB is thus a potential induced polarization (IP) target. Surface and cross-borehole electrical imaging (conductivity and IP) was conducted at a PRB installed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Kansas City plant. Poor signal strength (25% of measure-ments exceeding 8% reciprocal error) and insensitivity at depth, which results from current channeling in the highly conductive iron, limited surface imaging. Cross-hole 2D and 3D electrical measurements were highly effective at defining an accurate, approximately 0.3-m resolution, cross-sectional image of the barrier in-situ. Both the conductivity and IP images reveal the barrier geometry. Crosshole images obtained for seven panels along the barrier suggest variability in iron emplacement along the installation. On five panels the PRB structure is imaged as a conductive feature exceeding 1 S/m. However, on two panels the conductivity in the assumed vicinity of the PRB is less than 1 S/m. The images also suggest variability in the integrity of the contact between the PRB and bedrock. This noninvasive, in-situ evaluation of barrier geometry using conductivity/IP has broad implications for the long-term monitoring of PRB performance as a method of hydrocarbon removal.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Kenneth H.</author><author>Ntarlagiannis, Dimitrios</author><author>Slater, Lee D.</author><author>Dohnalkova, Alice</author><author>Hubbard, Susan S.</author><author>Banfield, Jillian F.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical imaging of stimulated microbial biomineralization</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>0013-936X</isbn><accession-num>16245832</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/es0504035</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Williams et al. - 2005 - Geophysical imaging of stimulated microbial biomineralization(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Understanding how microorganisms influence the physical and chemical properties of the subsurface is hindered by our inability to observe microbial dynamics in real time and with high spatial resolution. Here, we investigate the use of noninvasive geophysical methods to monitor biomineralization at the laboratory scale during stimulated sulfate reduction under dynamic flow conditions. Alterations in sediment characteristics resulting from microbe-mediated sulfide mineral precipitation were concomitant with changes in complex resistivity and acoustic wave propagation signatures. The sequestration of zinc and iron in insoluble sulfides led to alterations in the ability of the pore fluid to conduct electrical charge and of the saturated sediments to dissipate acoustic energy. These changes resulted directly from the nucleation, growth, and development of nanoparticulate precipitates along grain surfaces and within the pore space. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) confirmed the sulfides to be associated with cell surfaces, with precipitates ranging from aggregates of individual 3-5 nm nanocrystals to larger assemblages of up to 10-20 microm in diameter. Anomalies in the geophysical data reflected the distribution of mineral precipitates and biomass over space and time, with temporal variations in the signals corresponding to changes in the aggregation state of the nanocrystalline sulfides. These results suggest the potential for using geophysical techniques to image certain subsurface biogeochemical processes, such as those accompanying the bioremediation of metal-contaminated aquifers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selker, John S.</author><author>Thévenaz, Luc</author><author>Huwald, Hendrik</author><author>Mallet, Alfred</author><author>Luxemburg, Wim</author><author>Van De Giesen, Nick</author><author>Stejskal, Martin</author><author>Zeman, Josef</author><author>Westhoff, Martijn</author><author>Parlange, Marc B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distributed fiber-optic temperature sensing for hydrologic systems</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1944-7973</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2006WR005326</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Selker et al. - 2006 - Distributed fiber-optic temperature sensing for hydrologic systems.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>[ 1] Instruments for distributed fiber-optic measurement of temperature are now available with temperature resolution of 0.01 degrees C and spatial resolution of 1 m with temporal resolution of fractions of a minute along standard fiber-optic cables used for communication with lengths of up to 30,000 m. We discuss the spectrum of fiber-optic tools that may be employed to make these measurements, illuminating the potential and limitations of these methods in hydrologic science. There are trade-offs between precision in temperature, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution, following the square root of the number of measurements made; thus brief, short measurements are less precise than measurements taken over longer spans in time and space. Five illustrative applications demonstrate configurations where the distributed temperature sensing (DTS) approach could be used: ( 1) lake bottom temperatures using existing communication cables, ( 2) temperature profile with depth in a 1400 m deep decommissioned mine shaft, ( 3) air-snow interface temperature profile above a snow-covered glacier, ( 4) air-water interfacial temperature in a lake, and ( 5) temperature distribution along a first-order stream. In examples 3 and 4 it is shown that by winding the fiber around a cylinder, vertical spatial resolution of millimeters can be achieved. These tools may be of exceptional utility in observing a broad range of hydrologic processes, including evaporation, infiltration, limnology, and the local and overall energy budget spanning scales from 0.003 to 30,000 m. This range of scales corresponds well with many of the areas of greatest opportunity for discovery in hydrologic science.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Naudet, V</author><author>Revil, A</author><author>Rizzo, E</author><author>Bottero, J.-Y</author><author>Bégassat, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Groundwater redox conditions and conductivity in a contaminant plume from geoelectrical investigations</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>8-22</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>contaminant plume</keyword><keyword>electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>fluid conductivity</keyword><keyword>redox potential</keyword><keyword>self-potential</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Naudet et al. - 2004 - Groundwater redox conditions and conductivity in a contaminant plume from geoelectrical investigations.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Accurate mapping of the electrical conductivity and redox potential of groundwater is important in delineating the shape of a contaminant plume. A map of redox potential in an aquifer is indicative of biodegradation of organic matter and of concentrations of redox-active components; a map of electrical conductivity provides information on the mineralisation of the groundwater. Both maps can be used to optimise the position of pumping wells for remediation. The self-potential method (SP) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) have been applied to the contaminant plume associated with the Entressen landfill in south-east France. The self-potential depends on groundwater flow (electrokinetic contribution) and redox conditions (electro-redox contribution). Using the variation of the piezometric head in the aquifer, the electrokinetic contribution is removed from the SP signals. A good linear correlation (R²=0.85) is obtained between the residual SP data and the redox potential values measured in monitoring wells. This relationship is used to draw a redox potential map of the overall contaminated site. The electrical conductivity of the subsoil is obtained from 3D-ERT analysis. There is good linear correlation (R²=0.91) between the electrical conductivity of the aquifer determined from the 3D-ERT image and the conductivity of the groundwater measured in boreholes. This indicates that the formation factor is nearly homogeneous in the shallow aquifer at the scale of the ERT. From this correlation, a map of the pore water conductivity of the aquifer is obtained.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mansoor, Nasser</author><author>Slater, Lee</author><author>Artigas, Francisco</author><author>Auken, Esben</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution geophysical characterization of shallow-water wetlands</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.2210307</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mansoor et al. - Unknown - High-resolution geophysical characterization of shallow-water wetlands.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We describe a procedure for rapid characterization of shallow-water, contaminated wetlands. Terrain-conductiv-ity ͑TC͒, vertical-magnetic-gradiometry, and surface-water-chemistry data were obtained from a shallow-draft paddle-boat operable in as little as 0.3 m of water. Measurements were taken every 2 s, with data-acquisition rates exceeding 10 km of line ͑Ͼ12 000 data points͒ per 8-hr field day. We applied this procedure to an urban wetland that is af-fected by point and nonpoint sources of pollution. We used a one-dimensional, laterally constrained inversion algorithm to invert the apparent-conductivity data set obtained from the TC survey and to create a pseudo-2D image of sediment con-ductivity. The continuously recorded surface-water depth and conductivity values were input as a priori information in the inversion. We used soil chemistry determined for 28 sedi-ment samples collected from the site, as well as lithologic logs from across the wetland, to constrain interpretation of the geophysical data. The inverted sediment conductivity de-scribes a pattern of contamination probably attributable to leachates from adjacent landfills and/or to saltwater ingress from a partial tidal connection that is not obvious in the sur-face-water data. Magnetic-gradiometry values and the in-phase component of an EM31 response both reflect primarily the distribution of junk metal associated with a legacy of ille-gal dumping. Historic aerial photographs suggest that this distribution reflects land-use history and defines the maxi-mum previous extent of an adjacent landfill and a pattern of dumping correlated with historic roadways.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, Ping Yu</author><author>Alumbaugh, David</author><author>Brainard, Jim</author><author>Hall, Laila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-borehole ground-penetrating radar for monitoring and imaging solute transport within the vadose zone</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>00431397</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004WR003871</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Chang et al. - 2006 - Cross-borehole ground-penetrating radar for monitoring and imaging solute transport within the vadose zone.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>ASTM D 5753-95_Borehole Geophysical Logging.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Guide for using Gravity Method D 6430 - 99.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Guide for Selecting Surface Geophysical Methods ASTM D 6429 - 99.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volkmann, J</author><author>Klitzsch, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of low frequency polarization models using well characterized sintered porous glass samples</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>39-53</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Impedance spectroscopy</keyword><keyword>Low frequency polarization models</keyword><keyword>Spectral induced polarization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092698511530063X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Recently, significant progress has been made in understanding low frequency complex conductivity measurements of rocks. The relevant publications study these methods in two different ways: On the one hand, petrophysical interpretation has been improved in terms of theoretical approaches. These approaches are either modifications of pore size related membrane polarization concepts or rely on grain size related polarization models in combination with semi-empirical model function parameterizations. On the other hand, extensive petrophysical studies provide insight in dependencies of IS parameters on structural and electrochemical rock properties. We aim at assessing the results of published theoretical and experimental findings for a reference system, consisting of sintered porous glass samples. Thereby, we benefit from well characterized samples, which allow for direct tests of theoretical predictions and empirical relations. We find that: (1) The correlation σ ″ ~ Sm is stronger than σ ″ ~ Spor for a wide range of fluid conductivities and frequencies above 1 Hz. (2) Correlation coefficients for the imaginary conductivity to inner surface area relations are strongly frequency dependent. (3) Normalized chargeability, obtained by fitting a Cole–Cole model to the spectral data, provides a fair alternative to single frequency information. (4) Correlation breaks down for disturbed fluid–surface interaction by wettability manipulation. (5) Salinity dependence of proportionality factors a1 = Sm/σ″ and a2 = Spor/σ″ due to a salinity dependent partition coefficient is confirmed qualitatively. Quantitative theoretic predictions of a1 or a2 fail due to the assumption of non-reduced Stern layer mobility for clay free silica. (6) Earliest grain size related models provide the best quantitative estimate of relaxation time. (7) Results agree well with published data for sands and sandstones with respect to (i) quantitative estimates of a1 or a2 and (ii) influences of rock structural parameters on relaxation time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Rationale for ASTM Geophysics Guide.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><titles><title>TDEM ASTM D 6820 - 02.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merritt, A J</author><author>Chambers, J E</author><author>Wilkinson, P B</author><author>West, L J</author><author>Murphy, W</author><author>Gunn, D</author><author>Uhlemann, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measurement and modelling of moisture—electrical resistivity relationship of fine-grained unsaturated soils and electrical anisotropy</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>155-165</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)</keyword><keyword>Electropetrophysics</keyword><keyword>Landslide study</keyword><keyword>Soil testing</keyword><keyword>Unsaturated petrophysical relationships</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985115300574</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract A methodology for developing resistivity-moisture content relationships of materials associated with a clayey landslide is presented. Key elements of the methodology include sample selection and preparation, laboratory measurement of resistivity with changing moisture content, and the derivation of models describing the relationship between resistivity and moisture content.  Laboratory resistivity measurements show that the techniques utilised (samples and square array) have considerable potential as a means of electropetrophysical calibration of engineering soils and weak rock. Experimental electrical resistivity results show a hierarchy of values dependent on sample lithology, with silty clay exhibiting the lowest resistivities, followed by siltstones and sands, which return the highest resistivities. In addition, finer grained samples show a greater degree of anisotropy between measurement orientations than coarser grained samples.  However, suitability of results in light of issues such as sample cracking and electrical conduction must be identified and accounted for if the results are to be accurately up-scaled to inverted model resistivity results. The existence of directional anisotropy makes model calibration curve selection more difficult due to variability in the range of measured laboratory resistances.  The use of larger measurement array size means that experimental data will be more representative of bulk lithological properties. In addition, use of electrodes with a relatively high surface area (wide diameter) help maintain low contact resistances and repeat measurement error, relative to narrow electrodes.  Variation exists between the fit of experimental data and petrophysical models. Model fit is best for clay-dominated samples but fits less well for sand-dominated samples. Waxman–Smits equation is appropriately applied in this investigation as all samples have considerable clay mineral content, as is shown in non-negligible CEC results. The incorporation of pressure plate suction measurements on samples, allows suction dissipation to be quantified and evaluated alongside moisture content and electrical resistivity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valaee, Morteza</author><author>Ayoubi, Shamsollah</author><author>Khormali, Farhad</author><author>Lu, Sheng Gao</author><author>Karimzadeh, Hamid Reza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using magnetic susceptibility to discriminate between soil moisture regimes in selected loess and loess-like soils in northern Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>23-30</pages><volume>127</volume><keywords><keyword>Iron forms</keyword><keyword>Loess soils</keyword><keyword>Magnetic measures</keyword><keyword>Northern Iran</keyword><keyword>Soil moisture regimes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.02.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116300362</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract This study used discriminant analysis to determine the efficacy of magnetic measures for discriminating between four soil moisture regimes in northern Iran. The study area was located on loess deposits and loess-like soils containing similar parent material. Four soil moisture regimes including aridic, xeric, udic, and aquic were selected. A total of 25 soil profiles were drug from each regime and composite soil samples were collected within the moisture control section. A set of magnetic measures including magnetic susceptibility at low (χlf) and high (χhf) frequencies, frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility (χfd), saturation isothermal remnant magnetization (SIRM), and isothermal remnant magnetization (IRM100 mT, IRM 20 mT) were measured in the laboratory. Dithionite citrate bicarbonate (Fed) and acid oxalate (Feo) contents of all soil samples were also determined. The lowest and highest χlf and χhf were observed in aquic and udic moisture regimes, respectively. A similar trend was obtained for Fed and Fed–Feo. The significant positive correlation between Fed and SIRM (r = 0.60; P &amp;lt; 0.01) suggested the formation of stable single domains (SSD) due to pedogenic processes. The results of discriminant analysis indicated that a combination of magnetic measures could successfully discriminate between the selected moisture regimes in the study area (average accuracy = 80%). It can thus be concluded that magnetic measures could be applied as a powerful indicator for differentiation of soil moisture regimes in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>FDEM ASTM 6639 - 01.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>GPR ASTM D 6432 - 99.pdf</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bellmunt, F</author><author>Marcuello, A</author><author>Ledo, J</author><author>Queralt, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capability of cross-hole electrical configurations for monitoring rapid plume migration experiments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>73-82</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Dataset optimization</keyword><keyword>Resistivity imaging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985115300628</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography is a useful tool in geotechnical, hydrogeological or fluid/gas plume migration studies. It allows better characterization of deep subsurface structures and monitoring of the involved processes. However, due to the large amount of possible four-electrode combinations between boreholes, the choice of the most efficient ones for rapid plume migration experiments (real-time monitoring), becomes a challenge. In this work, a numerical simulation to assess the capabilities and constraints of the most common cross-hole configurations for real-time monitoring is presented. Four-electrode configurations, sensitivity, dependence on the body location and amount of data were taken into account. The analysis of anomaly detection and the symmetry of the sensitivity pattern of cross-hole configurations allowed significant reduction of the amount of data and maintaining the maximum potential resolution of each configuration for real-time monitoring. The obtained results also highlighted the benefit of using the cross-hole AB–MN configuration (with both current – or potential – electrodes located in the same borehole) combined with other configurations with complementary sensitivity pattern.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Remediation Technologies Roundtable, Federal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical Techniques to Locate DNAPLs: Profiles of Federally Funded Projects</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Remediation Technologies Roundtable - 1998 - Geophysical Techniques to Locate DNAPLs Profiles of Federally Funded Projects(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benson, Richard C</author><author>Glaccum, Robert A</author><author>Noel, Michael R</author><author>Jeffrey Van Ee, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES FOR SENSING BURIED WASTES AND WASTE MIGRATION</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>1984</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Benson et al. - 1984 - GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES FOR SENSING BURIED WASTES AND WASTE MIGRATION.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>González-pinzón, Ricardo</author><author>Ward, Adam S</author><author>Hatch, Christine E</author><author>Wlostowski, Adam N</author><author>Singha, Kamini</author><author>Gooseff, Michael N</author><author>Haggerty, Roy</author><author>Harvey, Judson W</author><author>Cirpka, Olaf a</author><author>Brock, James T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A field comparison of multiple techniques to quantify groundwater – surface-water interactions</title><secondary-title>Freshwater Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Freshwater Science</full-title></periodical><pages>139-160</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>August 2014</issue><keywords><keyword>and heat with</keyword><keyword>ature sensing</keyword><keyword>biogeo-</keyword><keyword>distributed temper-</keyword><keyword>dts</keyword><keyword>electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>ground water</keyword><keyword>groundwater</keyword><keyword>heat as a tracer</keyword><keyword>hydraulic head</keyword><keyword>hyporheic exchange</keyword><keyword>natural streams exchange water</keyword><keyword>providing habitats and facilitating</keyword><keyword>resazurin</keyword><keyword>solutes</keyword><keyword>stream</keyword><keyword>tracers</keyword><keyword>transient storage</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>2161-9549</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1086/679738.</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://González-pinzón et al. - 2015 - A field comparison of multiple techniques to quantify groundwater – surface-water interactions.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Groundwater–surface-water (GW-SW) interactions in streams are difficult to quantify because of het-erogeneity in hydraulic and reactive processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.

Here we demonstrate the use of a minimally invasive geophysical technique to monitor stimulated microbial activity during acetate amendment in an aquifer near Rifle, Colorado. During electrical induced polarization (IP) measurements, spatiotemporal variations in the phase response between imposed electric current and the resultant electric field correlated with changes in groundwater geochemistry accompanying stimulated iron and sulfate reduction and sulfide mineral precipitation. The magnitude of the phase response varied with measurement frequency (0.125 and 1 Hz) and was dependent upon the dominant metabolic process. The spectral effect was corroborated using a biostimulated column experiment containing Rifle sediments and groundwater. Fluids and sediments recovered from regions exhibiting an anomalous phase response were enriched in Fe(II), dissolved sulfide, and cell-associated FeS nanoparticles. The accumulation of mineral precipitates and electroactive ions altered the ability of pore fluids to conduct electrical charge, accounting for the anomalous IP response and revealing the usefulness of multifrequency IP measurementsfor monitoring mineralogical and geochemical changes accompanying stimulated subsurface bioremediation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slater, L.

Effluent fluid electrical conductivity and early time σbwere modeled according to classic advective-dispersive transport of the nutrient medium. However, σbalong the column exhibited strongly bimodal breakthrough which cannot be explained by changes in the electrical conductivity of the pore fluid. We model the anomalous breakthrough by adding a conduction path in parallel with the fluid phase, with a time dependence described by a microbial population-dynamics model. We incorporate a delay time to show that breakthrough curves along the column satisfy the same growth model parameters and offer a possible explanation based on biomass-limited growth that is delayed with distance from influent of the nutrient medium. Although the mechanism causing conductivity enhancement in the presence of biomass is uncertain, our results strongly suggest that biogeochemical breakthrough curves have been captured in geoelectrical datasets.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Briggs, Martin A.</author><author>Lautz, Laura K.</author><author>Mckenzie, Jeffrey M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing to traditional methods of evaluating groundwater inflow to streams</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>1277-1290</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Distributed temperature sensing</keyword><keyword>Groundwater-surface-water interaction</keyword><keyword>Heat tracing</keyword><keyword>Tracer tests</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0885-6087</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.8200</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Briggs, Lautz, Mckenzie - 2012 - A comparison of fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing to traditional methods of evaluating ground.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>There are several methods for determining the spatial distribution and magnitude of groundwater inputs to streams. We compared the results of conventional methods [dye dilution gauging, acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) differential gauging, and geochemical end-member mixing] to distributed temperature sensing (DTS) using a fibre-optic cable installed along 900 m of Ninemile Creek in Syracuse, New York, USA, during low-flow conditions (discharge of 1·4 m3 s−1). With the exception of differential gauging, all methods identified a focused, contaminated groundwater inflow and produced similar groundwater discharge estimates for that point, with a mean of 66·8 l s−1 between all methods although the precision of these estimates varied. ADV discharge measurement accuracy was reduced by non-ideal conditions and failed to identify, much less quantify, the modest groundwater input, which was only 5% of total stream flow. These results indicate ambient tracers, such as heat and geochemical mixing, can yield spatially and quantitatively refined estimates of relatively modest groundwater inflow even in large rivers. DTS heat tracing, in particular, provided the finest spatial characterization of groundwater inflow, and may be more universally applicable than geochemical methods, for which a distinct and consistent groundwater end member may be more difficult to identify.

Since the resistivities of earth materials are sensitive to the presence of contaminants and their break-down products, 4-dimensional resistivity imaging can act as a surrogate monitoring technology for tracking and visualising changes in contaminant concentrations at much higher spatial and temporal resolution than manual intrusive investigations. The test site, a municipal car park built on a former gasworks, had been polluted by a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dissolved phase contaminants. It was designated statutory contaminated land under Part IIA of the UK Environmental Protection Act due to the risk of polluting an underlying minor aquifer. Resistivity monitoring zones were established on the boundaries of the site by installing vertical electrode arrays in purpose-drilled boreholes. After a year of monitoring data had been collected, a tracer test was performed to investigate groundwater flow velocity and to demonstrate rapid volumetric monitoring of natural attenuation processes. A saline tracer was injected into the confined aquifer, and its motion and evolution were visualised directly in high-resolution tomographic images in near real-time. Breakthrough curves were calculated from independent resistivity measurements, and the estimated seepage velocities from the monitoring images and the breakthrough curves were found to be in good agreement with each other and with estimates based on the piezometric gradient and assumed material parameters. ?? 2009 Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mawer, Chloe</author><author>Kitanidis, Peter</author><author>Pidlisecky, Adam</author><author>Knight, Rosemary</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical Resistivity for Characterization and Infiltration Monitoring beneath a Managed Aquifer Recharge Pond</title><secondary-title>Vadose Zone Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vadose Zone Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2136/vzj2011.0203</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mawer et al. - 2013 - Electrical Resistivity for Characterization and Infiltration Monitoring beneath a Managed Aquifer Recharge Pond.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.soils.org/publications/vzj/abstracts/12/1/vzj2011.0203</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bignardi, S.</author><author>Mantovani, A.</author><author>Abu Zeid, N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>OpenHVSR: Imaging the subsurface 2D/3D elastic properties through multiple HVSR modeling and inversion</title><secondary-title>Computers and Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers and Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>103-113</pages><volume>93</volume><keywords><keyword>2-D</keyword><keyword>3-D</keyword><keyword>HVSR</keyword><keyword>Microtremor</keyword><keyword>Soil amplification</keyword><keyword>Soil response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cageo.2016.05.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bignardi, Mantovani, Abu Zeid - 2016 - OpenHVSR Imaging the subsurface 2D3D elastic properties through multiple HVSR modeling and invers.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2016.05.009</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OpenHVSR is a computer program developed in the Matlab environment, designed for the simultaneous modeling and inversion of large Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR or H/V) datasets in order to construct 2D/3D subsurface models (topography included). The program is designed to provide a high level of interactive experience to the user and still to be of intuitive use. It implements several effective and established tools already present in the code ModelHVSR by Herak (2008), and many novel features such as: -confidence evaluation on lateral heterogeneity -evaluation of frequency dependent single parameter impact on the misfit function -relaxation of Vp/Vs bounds to allow for water table inclusion -a new cost function formulation which include a slope dependent term for fast matching of peaks, which greatly enhances convergence in case of low quality HVSR curves inversion -capability for the user of editing the subsurface model at any time during the inversion and capability to test the changes before acceptance. In what follows, we shall present many features of the program and we shall show its capabilities on both simulated and real data. We aim to supply a powerful tool to the scientific and professional community capable of handling large sets of HSVR curves, to retrieve the most from their microtremor data within a reduced amount of time and allowing the experienced scientist the necessary flexibility to integrate into the model their own geological knowledge of the sites under investigation. This is especially desirable now that microtremor testing has become routinely used. After testing the code over different datasets, both simulated and real, we finally decided to make it available in an open source format. The program is available by contacting the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zelt, C A</author><author>Azaria, A</author><author>Levander, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3D seismic refraction traveltime tomography at a groundwater contamination site</title><secondary-title>Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>basin</keyword><keyword>british-columbia</keyword><keyword>crustal structure</keyword><keyword>inversion</keyword><keyword>resolution</keyword><keyword>ridge</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.2258094</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>We have applied traveltime tomography to 3D seismic refraction data collected at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, in an approximately 95 X 40-m area over a shallow (&lt; 20 m) groundwater contamination site. The purpose of this study is to test the ability of 3D first-arrival-time data to characterize the shallow environment and aid remediation efforts. The aquifer is bounded below by a clay aquiclude, into which a paleochannel has been incised and acts as a trap for dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminants. A regularized nonlinear tomographic approach was applied to 187,877 first-arrival traveltimes to obtain the smoothest minimum-structure 3D velocity model. The resulting velocity model contains a velocity increase from less than 300 to 1500 m/s in the upper 15 m. The model also contains a north-south-trending low-velocity feature interpreted to be the paleochannel, based on more than 100 wells in the area. Checkerboard tests show 7.5-10 m lateral resolution throughout most of the model. The preferred final model was chosen after a systematic test of the free parameters involved in the tomographic approach, including the starting model. The final velocity model compares favorably with a 3D poststack depth migration and 2D waveform inversion of coincident reflection data. While the long-wavelength features of the model reveal the primary target of the survey, the paleochannel, the velocity model is likely a very smooth characterization of the true velocity structure, particularly in the vertical direction, given the size of the first Fresnel zone for these data.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Fuchun</author><author>Levander, Alan R.</author><author>Pratt, R.

In such cases, geophysical methods can be used to map the distribution of subsurface contamination or buried wastes prior to drilling or sampling. For example, inorganic contamination by acids, bases, salts, or metallic ions can be detected by instruments that measure ground conductivity; metallic objects such as buried drums, pipelines, etc. can be located by magnetic survey, and radioactive mine waste can be mapped by radiometric techniques. Geophysical methods can also be used to characterize site geology. If carried out prior to development, they can assist in identifying areas of high- and low-permeability and sources of natural contamination. The methods can also be used to establish baseline values and to locate stable areas for development of environmentally sensitive facilities. Application of geophysical methods to environmental problems is illustrated with examples from base-metal mines, uranium operations, and potash and oil-sands operations. Particular attention is given to the problem of acid mine drainage.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Salvage, K</author><author>Graney, J</author><author>Barker, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Watershed-based integration of hydrology, geochemistry, and geophysics in an environmental geology curriculum</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geoscience Education</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geoscience Education</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>curriculum</keyword><keyword>environmental geology</keyword><keyword>geography education</keyword><keyword>geophysics</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>interdisciplinary approach</keyword><keyword>learning</keyword><keyword>student</keyword><keyword>watershed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls/><abstract>Inquiry-based study focused on the campus watershed was initiated at Binghamton University after creation of an undergraduate Environmental Geology Track within the Geological Sciences curriculum. Use of the watershed in environmental geology courses has been implemented to 1) promote active learning outside of the classroom; 2) allow students to work with state of the art field and laboratory equipment and &quot;real world&quot; data; and 3) encourage age interdisciplinary thinking. The longer-term goal is to enable undergraduates to conduct meaningful, field based, &quot;capstone&quot; research projects. A grant from the National Science Foundation supported instrumentation of the entire campus watershed into a readily accessible field laboratory; included are groundwater monitoring a wells, equipment for measuring and sampling stream flow, a meteorological station, a wet and dry deposition collector for sampling atmospheric quality, and portable environmental monitoring equipment. In addition, geophysical equipment, including seismic refraction and reflection, DC electrical resistivity, and gravity anomaly measurements, is used to determine subsurface structure at various locations on campus. The undergraduates are now able to explore differences in physical and chemical processes between and within the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere on real-time scales. The use of this equipment and the watershed focus has been fully incorporated into three inquiry-based undergraduate courses (Environmental Hydrology, Environmental Geophysics, and Environmental Measurements) to foster interdisciplinary learning about the complexity of water-shed-based processes.

These tools include gravity, magnetic, seismic, electrical, electromagnetic, and radioactivity studies. All aspects of these methods are described, including theoretical considerations, data acquisition, and data processing and interpretation, with the objective of locating concentrations of natural resources and defining their extent. In the past fourteen years or so since the writing of Applied Geophysics, there have been many changes in the field of exploration geophysics. The authors give full treatment to changes in this field, which include improved techniques for calculating gravity fields, the use of proton-precession and optically-pumped magnetometers, improved quality of seismic data, magnetotelluric as a practical exploration method, new electromagnetic exploration methods, the use of gamma-ray spectrometers in radioactive exploration, and improved well-logging techniques. The intent is to be practical, and thus many actual examples and problems are given. Moreover, wherever possible in this edition the authors adopt the use of Système Internationale (SI) units, which were not in standared use at the time of the first edition. The reader needs only a general background knowledge of geology, physics, and mathematics. Most of the math can be skipped by those interested only in the results. Advanced mathematical concepts are explained in the appendix.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pettersson, Jared K.</author><author>Nobes, David C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental geophysics at Scott Base: Ground penetrating radar and electromagnetic induction as tools for mapping contaminated ground at Antarctic research bases</title><secondary-title>Cold Regions Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cold Regions Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Antarctica</keyword><keyword>Electromagnetic methods</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Ground penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Hydrocarbon-contaminated</keyword><keyword>Permafrost</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>0165-232X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0165-232X(03)00037-5</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Mapping the extent of hydrocarbon spills in Antarctica is commonly done by hand sampling of active layer soils and by mechanical coring deeper into the frozen layer. While these methods provide reliable results, the act of obtaining samples can cause almost as much damage to the site as the contamination. A nondestructive, noninvasive method to map extent of hydrocarbon (JP5, JP8) spills on dry permafrost would provide a more environmentally sound contaminated site management tool. This study provides a base knowledge of how noninvasive nondestructive geophysical surveying can be used to map hydrocarbon spills in an Antarctic permafrost setting, and establishes its suitability as a tool for environmental monitoring at Antarctic bases. Geophysical surveys were undertaken at Scott Base, Antarctica, using ground penetrating radar (GPR) and the EM31??? horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) instrument. Surveys were carried out over the same location before and after the summer melt. Areas known to be hydrocarbon-contaminated appeared as resistive anomalies using an EM31. Variations in the geophysical response between surveys were found, with conductivities increasing, on average, by a factor of two for the late summer, but resistive anomalies persisted. GPR was not successful in direct detection of contaminated ground; however, it did provide valuable information on the nature of the subsurface which is useful to predict future movement of contaminants. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The disposal of hazardous material from urban waste dumps, milling wastes in tailings ponds, and industrial wastes in injection wells may contaminate potential sources of potable ground water. The containment or migration of contaminants in the subsurface depends on bedrock characteristics and type of overlying sediments. Fractured bedrock and permeable sediments that may provide pathways for the transport of potentially harmful contaminants should be avoided when selecting a disposal site. The role of borehole geophysics in hazardous waste-site investigations is reviewed in three categories: (1) site selection; (2) determination Of the extent of contamination at existing sites; and (3) long-term monitoring of migration of contaminants. In the first category, borehole geophysical techniques developed for lithology and fracture identification, and for porosity determination, provide some of the necessary information for understanding the subsurface hydrogeology. Lithological information can be obtained from gamma-ray, electrical resistivity, induction, magnetic susceptibility, and sometimes induced polarization logs; fracture detection and characterization can be accomplished with the use of caliper, density, resistivity, temperature, and acoustic televiewer logs. Estimates of porosity are derived primarily from neutron-neutron, resistivity, density, and sonic logs. Borehole geophysical techniques used in water-quality determinations include self-potential, fluid resistivity, Eh (redox potentials) and pH measurements, and these can be used to map the extent of contamination at an existing waste site. Cross-borehole and borehole-to-surface electrical methods can also be used in this application. Long-term monitoring of contaminant migration in boreholes can be accomplished with techniques that respond to changes in electrical conductivity, temperature and fluid chemistry caused by the presence of contaminants.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Prem V.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental and engineering geophysics</title><secondary-title>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>icle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><isbn>9781139171168</isbn><accession-num>25246403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9781139171168</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by β-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all β-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic β-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of β-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steeples, Don W.</author><author>Miller, Richard D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seismic Reflection Methods Applied to Engineering, Environmental , and Groundwater Problems The Basics of Various Seismic Methods</title><secondary-title>Volumes on Geotechnical and Environmental Geophysics, Vol 1</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Volumes on Geotechnical and Environmental Geophysics, Vol 1</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><isbn>9788578110796</isbn><accession-num>25246403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The seismic-reflection method, a powerful geophysical exploration technique that has been in widespread use in the petroleum industry for more than 60 years, has been used increasingly since 1980 in applications shallower than 30m. The seismic-reflection method measures different parameters than other geophysical methods, and requires careful attention to avoid possible pitfalls in data collection, processing, and interpretation. Part of the key to avoiding the pitfalls is to understand the resolution limits of the technique, and to plan carefully shallow-reflection surveys around the geologic objective and the resolution limits. Careful planning is also necessary to make the method increasingly cost effective relative to test drilling and other geophysical methods. The selection of seismic recording equipment, energy source, and data-acquisition parameters is often critical to the success of a shallow-reflection project. By following known seismic reflections carefully throughout the data-processing phase misinterpretation of things that look like reflections but aren't is avoided. The shallow-reflection technique has recently been used in mapping bedrock beneath alluvium in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites, detecting abandoned coal mines, following the top of the saturated zone during a pump test in an alluvial aquifer, and in mapping shallow faults. As resolution improves and cost-effectiveness increases, other new applications will be added.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Styles, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental geophysics: A site characterization tool for urban regeneration in the post-mining era</title><secondary-title>Geology Today</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geology Today</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-2451.2003.00407.x</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>The closure and decay of industrial activity involving mining, chemical or light industrial operations has scarred the landscape of urban areas.

We used pulses centered from 150–200 MHz and 300–360 MHz. The boulder-rich sediments reside over granitic and metavolcanics, the horizons of which we recognize from the relative strengths and phase of their waveforms, underlying fractures, and well-developed diffraction asymptotes. The till produced an apparent dense distribution of diffractions with limited asymptotes and dispersion, and occasional minor stratification. We use these diffractions and moveout profiles to calculate relative dielectric permittivities between 17 and 27, values which suggest up to 30% volumetric water, and likely saturation within these over-consolidated sediments. The evidence for transitions from till to bedrock ranges from a simple horizon to complex horizon segments, all characterized by diffractions and amenable to single-layer migration. A gradational loss in diffraction strength with depth suggests gradational weathering or changes in grain size as the cause. Maximum profiled depths range from 4 m to at least 10 m, with estimated scattering attenuation rates of about 3.3 dB m21. In contrast, one and possible two colluvial diamicts, which likely contained 3-m-size boulders, show short segments of stratification, rare diffraction asymptotes, allow more than 20-m penetration and provide scattering losses of about 0.5 dB m21. We measured extremely low conductivity and calculated permittivities ranging from 9–12, which suggest high densities and volumetric water content of 4–12%. Low, single scattering loss and deep penetration in the till are consistent with evidence of ground waves traveling up to 40 m one way. The phase polarity of waveforms within till and colluvial events show they may originate from either high or low dielectric contrasts, likely related to water or large boulders, respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, J M</author><author>Zhang, C H</author><author>Xiao, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Some experimental results of relation between the electrical conductivity, induced polarization of polluted water and the variation of the pollution concentration</title><secondary-title>Engineering and Environmental Geophysics for the 21st Century</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Engineering and Environmental Geophysics for the 21st Century</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1997</year></dates><urls/><abstract>In order to find out the possibility of adopting resistivity method, electromagnetic method and induced polarization method to inspect polluted groundwater, we present some experimental results of resistivity (rho), polarizability (eta), half decay time (s(t)), the rate of deviation (r) et al.

Reynolds1 offers a case study of how environmental geophysics can provide the tools for effective survey and analysis of pollution hazards.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade or so, environmental geophysics* has really come of age. Two aspects have changed in particular: first, environmental geophysics is being used to investigate sites that 10 years ago would have been impossible or considered as ‘research’ sites. The technology for both acquiring and handling data, as well as increasingly sophisticated and easy to use software have enabled much more data (and with much finer spatial sampling) to be acquired with better quality and to be analysed more robustly. The downside of this ease of use is that more unqualified and inexperienced people are entering the ‘industry’ (note I did not say ‘profession’!) and there are more examples of bad surveys occurring. The second key factor is the regulatory and legislative climate that prevails; the UK is fast catching up with the USA in its increasing recourse to the law courts. Clients are not just looking for geological, environmental or engineering targets any more. Rather, there is a very rapidly developing use of environmental geophysics as a risk management tool.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corwin, R.

Before the start of invasive site investi- gations, a trial geophysical survey was conducted involving magnetics and electromagnetics. This trial demonstrated that the electromagnetic technique, involving a Geonics EM31 soil conductivity meter, was capable of detecting subsurface metal pipes and contaminant concentrations resulting from the oil terminal works. The EM31 is directionally dependent and yields different results when its boom is either parallel or perpendicular to subsurface linear anomalies. This directionality can lead to misleading interpretations. By taking the second derivative of the EM31 quadrature response, a new directionally independent map is presented with no such interpretation difficulties. A full, detailed electromagnetic survey revealed a labyrinth of subsurface pipes about 1 m deep together with a number of anomalously low conductivity regions. Trial pits and trenches vali- dated the geophysical interpretation, even to the extent of finding tarry contaminants emanating from the ends of broken pipes. This has led to a two-stage remediation programme in which the pipes will first have to be carefully extracted.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reynolds, J M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Introduction to Applied and Environmental Geophysics.</title><secondary-title>Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>9780471485360</isbn><accession-num>25246403</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This college-level textbook provides a basic introduction to geophysics emphasing the applications over the mathematics and theoretical physics.

A layered heterogeneous porous media was represented in a 2D sandbox filled with two layers of coarse and medium silica sand. Based on previous tests, the surfactant solution used was Ammonyx Lo at a concentration of 0.1% (w/w). The sandbox experimental program included tracer tests done under both uncontaminated and contaminated conditions, foam injection under uncontaminated conditions and surfactant solution and foam injection under contaminated conditions. Tracer tests indicated that the permeability contrast between sand layers was increased by LNAPL contamination. Foam injection under uncontaminated conditions presented a S-shaped front that indicated a better mobility control than the piston-shaped front obtained during tracer tests. During foam injection, complete sweep of the sandbox was achieved with 1.8 pore volume (PV) compared to 2.8 PV during tracer injection, thus indicating better mobility control with foam. Pre-flush of the contaminated sandbox with surfactant solution initiated p-xylene mobilization but no free phase was recovered at the effluent. A negligible p-xylene residual saturation was reached following foam injection in the contaminated sandbox. However, mass balance indicated a total recovery of only 48% of the initial p-xylene, thus indicating an underestimation of the recovery by volatilization. Recovery by volatilization was corrected, which gave the following proportions of LNAPL recovery mechanisms: 19% by mobilization, 16% by dissolution and 65% by volatilization. Results show the potential efficiency of foam remediation of LNAPL source zones in heterogeneous porous media. Still, further developments are needed prior to field scale application, which could benefit from in situ foam production that would simplify on-site operations.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Liu, Jiangping</author><author>Liu, Hao</author><author>Tian, Zhijian</author><author>Cheng, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling and locating underground water pipe leak with microseismic data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>136</volume><keywords><keyword>Continuous random source</keyword><keyword>Cross-correlation</keyword><keyword>Pipeline leak location</keyword><keyword>Simulated annealing algorithm</keyword><keyword>Viscoacoustic finite-difference simulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.10.030</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116304542</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Traditional pipeline leak locating methods require that geophones have to be placed on the pipe wall. While if the exact location of the pipeline is unknown, the leaks may not be identified accurately. To solve this problem, considering the characteristics of pipeline leak, a continuous random seismic source model is proposed and geological models are established. Based on the two dimensional (2D) viscoacoustic equations and the staggered grid finite-difference (FD) algorithm, the microseismic wave field generated by a leaking pipe is modeled. Cross-correlation analysis and the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm are employed to obtain the time difference and the leak location. Analysis and discussions of the effects of number of recorded traces, survey layout, and offset and trace interval on the accuracy of the estimated location are also conducted. Simulation and data field experiment results indicate that: (1) A continuous random source can realistically represent the leak microseismic wave field in a simulation using 2D viscoacoustic equations and staggered grid FD algorithm. (2) For the leak microseismic wave field, the cross-correlation method is effective for calculating time difference of the direct wave relative to the reference trace. However, outside the refraction blind zone, accuracy of the time difference is reduced by the effects of refracted wave. (3) The SA algorithm based upon time difference, helps to identify the leak location effectively, even in the presence of noise. Estimation of the horizontal distance is more accurate than that of the depth, and the locating errors increase with increasing number of traces and offset. Moreover, in the refraction blind zone, trace interval has almost no impact on the accuracy of the location estimate. And the symmetrical array provides a higher estimate accuracy than the asymmetrical array.

In the study area, uncontrolled landfill leachate is a serious cause of groundwater contamination that occurs extensively and rapidly following the rainy season. For this reason, the use of traditional hydrogeological monitoring methods using drilled wells is expensive and limited. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) is suitable for monitoring groundwater contamination because this method helps quickly investigate a large site without the need for well drilling. The resistivity of the landfill leachate is lower than that of clean groundwater; based on this fact, we evaluated the diffusion of landfill leachate before and after the rainy season using 3-D ERI characterization. In addition, ERI results were compared with piezometric and hydrochemical data obtained from observation wells for the purpose of cross-validation. The groundwater monitoring results agreed with the 2-D and 3-D interpretation of ERI results. The electrical resistivity values of contaminated zones were lower than those of clean zones due to an abundance of ions or molecules in the groundwater. The resistivity boundary between contaminated and clean zones observed in the inverted 2-D and 3-D ERI sections was considered to be approximately 100 Ω-m. The low-resistivity anomaly of the contamination zones increased in extent after rainfall. The expansion was likely accelerated by groundwater movement and diffusion of the landfill leachate. Images of the change in electrical resistivity were helpful for characterization of the behavior. The two-directional behaviors of NE-SW and N-S trends were confirmed by the 3-D ratio images. It is therefore, considered that the ERI technique is excellent for imaging contaminated zones as well as monitoring the behaviors of landfill leachate in uncontrolled landfills.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitchell, Michael A</author><author>Oldenburg, Douglas W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data quality control methodologies for large, non-conventional DC resistivity datasets</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>163-182</pages><volume>135</volume><keywords><keyword>3D inversion</keyword><keyword>DC resistivity (ERT/ERI)</keyword><keyword>Data clustering</keyword><keyword>Data quality control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.09.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116303020</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
With developments in instrumentation and computational resources, the collection of large, non-conventional DC resistivity datasets has become commonplace. While the increased data content of these large datasets can significantly improve the resolution of inverse models, these datasets also present challenges for standard data quality control (QC) methodologies. Standard QC methodologies for DC resistivity datasets typically rely on our ability to decompose the dataset into 2D lines and/or reciprocal measurements. Non-conventional electrode geometries and the cost of collecting a large number of reciprocal measurements can severely limit the applicability of standard DC resistivity QC methodologies.

To address these limitations, we developed a more generalized data QC methodology which utilizes statistical analysis and classification tools. The merit of this methodology is illustrated using a field dataset collected in an underground potash mine and several synthetic examples. Results from these applications show that the methodology has the ability to identify and characterize highly noise-contaminated data from a number of different sources. The flexibility of the 4-stage methodology allows it be tailored to accommodate data from any type of DC resistivity survey and the use of statistical analysis and classification tools decreases the subjectivity of the process. Although this study focuses on the applicability of this methodology for DC resistivity data, it is potentially applicable to a variety of geophysical surveys.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Higgins, Gary H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of the ground‐water contamination hazard from underground nuclear explosions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Geophysical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1509-1519</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1959</year></dates><publisher>Wiley Online Library</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vienken, Thomas</author><author>Huber, Emanuel</author><author>Kreck, Manuel</author><author>Huggenberger, Peter</author><author>Dietrich, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How to chase a tracer – combining conventional salt tracer testing and direct push electrical conductivity profiling for enhanced aquifer characterization</title><secondary-title>Advances in Water Resources</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Water Resources</full-title></periodical><pages>60-66</pages><volume>99</volume><keywords><keyword>Direct push</keyword><keyword>Hydrogeology</keyword><keyword>Subsurface characterization</keyword><keyword>Tracer test</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.advwatres.2016.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Vienken et al. - 2016 - How to chase a tracer – combining conventional salt tracer testing and direct push electrical conductivity profi.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>a b s t r a c t Tracer testing is a well-established technique in hydrogeological site characterization. However, certain a priori knowledge of the hydraulic regime is required beforehand to avoid test failure, e.g. miss of tracer. In this study, we propose a novel tracer test concept for the hydraulic characterization of shallow unconsol-idated sedimentary deposits when only scarce a priori information on the hydraulic regime is available. Therefore, we combine conventional salt tracer testing with direct push vertical high resolution electrical conductivity logging. The proposed tracer test concept was successfully tested on coarse, braided river deposits of the Tagliamento River, Italy. With limited a priori information available two tracer tests were performed in three days to reliably determine ground water flow direction and velocity allowing on-site decision-making to adaptively install observation wells for reliable breakthrough curve measurements. Furthermore, direct push vertical electrical profiling provided essential information about the plume char-acteristics with outstanding measurement resolution and efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dale Werkema Jr, D</author><author>Atekwana, Estella A</author><author>Endres, Anthony L</author><author>Sauck, William A</author><author>Cassidy, Daniel P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating the geoelectrical response of hydrocarbon contamination undergoing biodegradation</title><secondary-title>Geophys.

In the last decade, different kinds of in-situ methods have been increasingly used for hydrocarbon contamination remediation due to their effectiveness. One of these techniques operates by injection of chemical oxidant solution to remove (degrade) the subsurface contaminants. Our aim was to develop a surface (non-destructive) measurement strategy to monitor oxidative in-situ remediation processes. The difficulties of the presented study originate from the small volume of conductive solution that can be used due to environmental considerations, the effect of conductive groundwater and the high clay content of the targeted layer. Therefore a site specific synthetic modelling was necessary for measurement design involving the results of preliminary 2D ERT measurements, electrical conductivity measurements of different active agents and expected resistivity changes calculated by soil resistivity modelling. The results of soil resistivity modelling have suggested that the reagent have complex effects on contaminated soils because of chemical biodegradation. As a result the plume of resistivity changes caused by the injected agent was determined showing strong fracturing effect because of the high pressure of injection. Based on the sophisticated tests and synthetic modelling 3D time-lapse geo-electric measurements were proven to provide a usable monitoring tool for in-situ remediation to help in-field design of such techniques.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chambers, J.

Impedance measurements were made using a horizontal plane of 12 electrodes positioned at regular intervals around the centre of the column. A 2D inversion algorithm, which incorporated the cylindrical geometry of the column, was used to reconstruct resistivity and phase images from the measured data. Differential time-lapse images of DNAPL movement past the plane of electrodes were generated by the cell-by-cell subtraction of resistivity and phase baseline models from those associated with the DNAPL release stage of the experiment. The DNAPL pulse was clearly delineated as resistive anomalies in the differential time-lapse resistivity images. The spatial extent of the resistive anomalies indicated that in addition to vertical migration, some lateral spreading of the DNAPL had occurred. Residual contamination could be detected after quasi-static conditions were reestablished. Residual DNAPL saturation was estimated from the resistivity model data by applying Archie's second equation. Despite significant measured phase changes due to DNAPL contamination, the differential phase images revealed only weak anomalies associated with DNAPL flow; these anomalies could be seen only in the initial stages of the experiment during peak flow through the plane of electrodes. ?? 2003 NERC.

We investigate how soil moisture is affected by daily transpiration using time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) on a highly instrumented ponderosa pine and the surrounding soil throughout the growing season. By comparing sap flow measurements to the ERI data, we find that periods of high sap flow within the diel cycle are aligned with decreases in ground electrical conductivity and soil moisture due to drying of the soil during moisture uptake. As sap flow decreases during the night, the ground conductivity increases as the soil moisture is replenished. The mean and variance of the ground conductivity decreases into the summer dry season, indicating drier soil and smaller diel fluctuations in soil moisture as the summer progresses. Sap flow did not significantly decrease through the summer suggesting use of a water source deeper than 60 cm to maintain transpiration during times of shallow soil moisture depletion. ERI captured spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture on daily and seasonal timescales. ERI data on the tree showed a diel cycle of conductivity, interpreted as changes in water content due to transpiration, but changes in sap flow throughout the season could not be interpreted from ERI inversions alone due to daily temperature changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwartz, N.</author><author>Shalem, T.</author><author>Furman, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of organic acid on the spectral-induced polarization response of soil</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Journal International</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Journal International</full-title></periodical><volume>197</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/gji/ggt529</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>In spectral-induced polarization (SIP) studies of sites contaminated by organic hydrocarbons, it was shown that biodegradation by-products in general, and organic acids in particular, significantly alter the SIP signature of the subsurface. Still a systematic study that considers the effect of organic acid on the physicochemical and electrical (SIP) properties of the soil is missing. The goal of this work is to relate between the effect of organic acid on the physicochemical properties of the soil, and the soil electrical properties. To do so, we measured the temporal changes of the soil chemical (ion content) and electrical (low-frequency SIP) properties in response to influx of organic acid at different concentrations, gradually altering the soil pH. Our results show that organic acid reduces the soil pH, enhances mineral weathering and consequently reduces both the in-phase and quadrature conductivity. At the pH range where mineral weathering is most significant (pH 6-4.5) a negative linear relation between the soil pH and the soil formation factor was found, suggesting that mineral weathering changes the pore space geometry and hence affecting the in-phase electrical conductivity. In addition, we attribute the reduction in the quadrature conductivity to an exchange process between the natural cation adsorbed on the mineral surface and hydronium, and to changes in the width of the pore bottleneck that results from the mineral weathering. Overall, our results allow a better understanding of the SIP signature of soil undergoing acidification process in general and as biodegradation process in particular.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Revil, A.</author><author>Fernandez, P.</author><author>Mao, D.</author><author>French, H.

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) is an underutilized technology that could significantly enhance tertiary oil recovery. Previous research has shown the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method to be sensitive to microbial degradation of hydrocarbons, so the method should therefore be sensitive to MEOR treatments. To test this hypothesis, heavy-oil-containing sands were monitored for a period of approximately six months while undergoing MEOR treatment. SIP monitoring showed significant sensitivity to biodegradation induced changes. Increases in phase and imaginary conductivity, with a polarization peak centered on approximately 3-8 Hz, were observed for the two MEOR active columns. Similarly, the normalized chargeability, an integrated parameter of a Debye decomposition analysis of the spectra, showed a linear increase in time. Chromatographic methods confirmed oil biodegradation in the active columns. The SIP responses are likely the result of microbial processes and the changes they promote to oil properties, such as altering wettability, or possibly the effect of organic acid production. The results of this experiment indicate that SIP may be a viable method of monitoringMEOR processes. © 2013 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Book Section">7</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Comas, Xavier</author><author>Slater, Lee D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Noninvasive Field-Scale Characterization of Gaseous-Phase Methane Dynamics in Peatlands Using the Ground-Penetrating Radar Method</title><secondary-title>Carbon Cycling in Northern Peatlands</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Carbon Cycling in Northern Peatlands</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>9781118666661</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008GM000810</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a promising technology for investigating methane cycling in peatlands over a wide range of spatial scales. Unlike most commonly applied techniques that seek to ascertain information on the vertical distribution of peat structure and/or gas content, GPR can be employed entirely noninvasively with minimal disruption to the in situ gas regime. We discuss the following applications of the GPR method in peatlands research: (1) imaging the lateral continuity of confining layers that may permit free-phase gas (FPG) accumulation and regulate methane emissions; (2) estimation of vertical profiles of FPG content using surface and cross-hole measurements; and (3) noninvasive temporal monitoring of FPG production and emissions from a peat column. We present new GPR results that demonstrate how 1-D velocity profiles from the glacial Lake Agassiz peatland (GLAP) complex support the suggestion of accumulation of FPG below confining layers at 3-4 m depth. Using cross-borehole GPR data collected from a peatland in Maine, we show how GPR tomography (previously unapplied in peatlands) can image the spatial distribution of FPG content in Caribou Bog, with minimal invasiveness. We also present results of 3-D surface reflection amplitude analysis, suggesting that reflection amplitudes, in addition to travel times, may yield insights into changes in methane production and emissions (e.g., via ebullition) from peat soils. We finish by discussing limitations of the technique (e.g., petrophysical conversion) and recommendations for further research to improve the application of this technology in studies of methane cycling in northern peatlands.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binley, Andrew</author><author>Hubbard, Susan S.</author><author>Huisman, Johan A.</author><author>Revil, André</author><author>Robinson, David A.</author><author>Singha, Kamini</author><author>Slater, Lee D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The emergence of hydrogeophysics for improved understanding of subsurface processes over multiple scales</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><volume>51</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1944-7973</isbn><accession-num>26900183</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/2015WR017016</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A review of the emergence and development of hydrogeophysicsOutline of emerging techniques in hydrogeophysicsPresentation of future opportunities in hydrogeophysics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Behroozmand, Ahmad A.</author><author>Keating, Kristina</author><author>Auken, Esben</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Review of the Principles and Applications of the NMR Technique for Near-Surface Characterization</title><secondary-title>Surveys in Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surveys in Geophysics</full-title></periodical><volume>36</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0169-3298</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10712-014-9304-0</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent advances in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements for near-surface characterization using laboratory, borehole, and field technologies. During the last decade, NMR has become increasingly popular in near-surface geophysics due to substantial improvements in instrumentation, data processing, forward modeling, inversion, and measurement techniques. This paper starts with a description of the principal theory and applications of NMR. It presents a basic overview of near-surface NMR theory in terms of its physical background and discusses how NMR relaxation times are related to different relaxation processes occurring in porous media. As a next step, the recent and seminal near-surface NMR developments at each scale are discussed, and the limitations and challenges of the measurement are examined. To represent the growth of applications of near-surface NMR, case studies in a variety of different near-surface environments are reviewed and, as examples, two recent case studies are discussed in detail. Finally, this review demonstrates that there is a need for continued research in near-surface NMR and highlights necessary directions for future research. These recommendations include improving the signal-to-noise ratio, reducing the effective measurement dead time, and improving production rate of surface NMR (SNMR), reducing the minimum echo time of borehole NMR (BNMR) measurements, improving petrophysical NMR models of hydraulic conductivity and vadose zone parameters, and understanding the scale dependency of NMR properties.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Attwa, M.</author><author>Günther, T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spectral induced polarization measurements for predicting the hydraulic conductivity in sandy aquifers</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>17</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-17-4079-2013</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Field and laboratory spectral induced polariza- tion (SIP) measurements are integrated to characterize the hydrogeological conditions at the Schillerslage test site in Germany. The phase images are capable of monitoring thin peat layers within the sandy aquifers. However, the field re- sults show limitations of decreasing resolution with depth. In comparison with the field inversion results, the SIP lab- oratory measurements show a certain shift in SIP response due to different compaction and sorting of the samples. The SIP data are analyzed to derive an empirical relationship for predicting the hydraulic conductivity (K). In particular, two significant but weak correlations between individual real resistivities (ρ?) and relaxation times (τ), based on a De- bye decomposition (DD) model, with measured K are found for the upper groundwater aquifer. The maximum relaxation time (τmax) and logarithmically weighted average relaxation time (τlw) show a better relation with K values than the me- dian value τ50. A combined power law relation between in- dividual ρ? and τ with K is developed with an expression of A· (ρ?)B · (τlw)C, where A, B and C are determined us- ing a least-squares fit between the measured and predicted K. The suggested approach with the calculated coefficients of the first aquifer is applied for the second. Results show good correlation with the measured K indicating that the de- rived relationship is superior to single phase angle models as Börner or Slater models.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bièvre, Grégory</author><author>Lacroix, Pascal</author><author>Oxarango, Laurent</author><author>Goutaland, David</author><author>Monnot, Guy</author><author>Fargier, Yannick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integration of geotechnical and geophysical techniques for the characterization of a small earth-filled canal dyke and the localization of water leakage</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-15</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Earth-filled canal dyke</keyword><keyword>Geometry</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Internal erosion</keyword><keyword>Leakage</keyword><keyword>Water head</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301325</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This paper investigates the combined use of extensive geotechnical, hydrogeological and geophysical techniques to assess a small earth dyke with a permanent hydraulic head, namely a canal embankment. The experimental site was chosen because of known issues regarding internal erosion and piping phenomena. Two leakages were visually located following the emptying of the canal prior to remediation works. The results showed a good agreement between the geophysical imaging techniques (Electrical Resistivity Tomography, P- and SH-waves Tomography) and the geotechnical data to detect the depth to the bedrock and its lateral variations. It appeared that surface waves might not be fully adapted for dyke investigation because of the particular geometry of the studied dyke, non-respectful of the 1D assumption, and which induced depth and velocity discrepancies retrieved from Rayleigh and Love waves inversion. The use of these classical prospecting techniques however did not allow to directly locate the two leakages within the studied earth dyke. The analysis of ambient vibration time series with a modified beam-forming algorithm allowed to localize the most energetic water flow prior to remediation works. It was not possible to detect the leakage after remediation works, suggesting that they efficiently contributed to significantly reduce the water flow. The second leakage was not detected probably because of a non-turbulent water flow, generating few energetic vibrations.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boaga, Jacopo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The use of FDEM in hydrogeophysics: A review</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>36-46</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>EMI mapping</keyword><keyword>FDEM methods</keyword><keyword>Soil conductivity</keyword><keyword>Subsurface hydrology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301507</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Hydrogeophysics is a rapidly evolving discipline emerging from geophysical methods. Geophysical methods are nowadays able to illustrate not only the fabric and the structure of the underground, but also the subsurface processes that occur within it, as fluids dynamic and biogeochemical reactions. This is a growing wide inter-disciplinary field, specifically dedicated to revealing soil properties and monitoring processes of change due to soil/bio/atmosphere interactions. The discipline involves environmental, hydrological, agricultural research and counts application for several engineering purposes. The most frequently used techniques in the hydrogeophysical framework are the electric and electromagnetic methods because they are highly sensitive to soil physical properties such as texture, salinity, mineralogy, porosity and water content. Non-invasive techniques are applied in a number of problems related to characterization of subsurface hydrology and groundwater dynamic processes. Ground based methods, as electrical tomography, proved to obtain considerable resolution but they are difficult to extend to wider exploration purposes due to their logistical limitation. Methods that don't need electrical contact with soil can be, on the contrary, easily applied to broad areas. Among these methods, a rapidly growing role is played by frequency domain electro-magnetic (FDEM) survey. This is due thanks to the improvement of multi-frequency and multi-coils instrumentation, simple time-lapse repeatability, cheap and accurate topographical referencing, and the emerging development of inversion codes. From raw terrain apparent conductivity meter, FDEM survey is becoming a key tool for 3D soil characterization and dynamics observation in near surface hydrological studies. Dozens of papers are here summarized and presented, in order to describe the promising potential of the technique.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clémence, Houzé</author><author>Marc, Pessel</author><author>Véronique, Durand</author><author>Toihir, Ali</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring an artificial tracer test within streambed sediments with time lapse underwater 3D ERT</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>158-169</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>3D electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Hyporheic zone</keyword><keyword>Solute tracer study</keyword><keyword>Streambed sediments</keyword><keyword>Time lapse monitoring</keyword><keyword>Underwater geophysics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301349</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The stream-aquifer interface is considered a hotspot for environmental and ecological issues. Due to their complexity, the exchange mechanisms occurring between groundwater and surface water at this interface are not yet fully understood. Many studies have focused on the characterization of the two-dimensional distribution of an artificial tracer (generally injected into the stream) within and outside the streambed, but there is insufficient information about the 3D spatial distribution of the tracer fluxes and their temporal variations. We monitored the transport of an artificial solute tracer transport with 3D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in order to improve the 3D spatial resolution in the imaging of the first tens of centimeters of streambed sediments and propose an innovative approach of the three-dimensional and temporal observation of the water fluxes. The hydro-geophysical field measurements were made on a small stream located within the Orgeval watershed (Seine et Marne, France). Using a resistivimeter connected to 180 electrodes, 3D electrical resistivity tomograms were made on a riverbed section, as a brine tracer was injected directly into the hyporheic zone. Before the tracer monitoring, the static 3D resistivity tomograms were consistent with the lithological heterogeneities identified at the site. However, this study defines some prerequisites to high-resolution 3D underwater resistivity measurements: for instance, a precise knowledge of an eventual weak electrode contact and a spatial resolution identical in every spatial direction. First results show a rapid development and persistence of a conductive plume around the injection point which disappears progressively after the injection. Within the sediments top layer, preferential flowpaths were highlighted due to the highly heterogeneous medium and hydraulic conductivity. The riverbed topography showed some pool-riffle sequences which conduct the formation of local entering and exiting zones. It seems clear that riverbed heterogeneities drive some local exchanges between surface water and pore water, despite the gaining condition of the stream. Moreover, inversion and data processing appear very sensitive to the boundary condition variations, such as the thickness and the resistivity of the water layer. This makes a quantitative interpretation of tracer fluxes within the hyporheic zone difficult. We demonstrate that for this type of study, knowledge of these conditions and precise monitoring of their fluctuations in time are required.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lekmine, G</author><author>Auradou, H</author><author>Pessel, M</author><author>Rayner, J L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of tracer plume transport parameters in 2D saturated porous media by cross-borehole ERT imaging</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>291-305</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Cross-borehole ERT imaging</keyword><keyword>Groundwater contaminant</keyword><keyword>Tracer test experiments</keyword><keyword>Transport in porous media</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.024</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301908</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Cross-borehole ERT imaging was tested to quantify the average velocity and transport parameters of tracer plumes in saturated porous media. Seven tracer tests were performed at different flow rates and monitored by either a vertical or horizontal dipole-dipole ERT sequence. These sequences were tested to reconstruct the shape and temporally follow the spread of the tracer plumes through a background regularization procedure. Data sets were inverted with the same inversion parameters and 2D model sections of resistivity ratios were converted to tracer concentrations. Both array types provided an accurate estimation of the average pore velocity vz. The total mass Mtot recovered was always overestimated by the horizontal dipole-dipole and underestimated by the vertical dipole-dipole. The vertical dipole-dipole was however reliable to quantify the longitudinal dispersivity λz, while the horizontal dipole-dipole returned better estimation for the transverse component λx. λ and Mtot were mainly influenced by the 2D distribution of the cumulated electrical sensitivity and the Shadow Effects induced by the third dimension. The size reduction of the edge of the plume was also related to the inability of the inversion process to reconstruct sharp resistivity contrasts at the interface. Smoothing was counterbalanced by a non-realistic rise of the ERT concentrations around the centre of mass returning overpredicted total masses. A sensitivity analysis on the cementation factor m and the porosity ϕ demonstrated that a change in one of these parameters by 8% involved non negligible variations by 30 and 40% of the dispersion coefficients and mass recovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pallero, J L G</author><author>Fernández-Martínez, J L</author><author>Bonvalot, S</author><author>Fudym, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>3D gravity inversion and uncertainty assessment of basement relief via Particle Swarm Optimization</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>338-350</pages><volume>139</volume><keywords><keyword>Nonlinear gravity inversion</keyword><keyword>Particle Swarm Optimization</keyword><keyword>Pyrenees–Argelès-Gazost</keyword><keyword>Sedimentary basin</keyword><keyword>Uncertainty assessment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301337</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Nonlinear gravity inversion in sedimentary basins is a classical problem in applied geophysics. Although a 2D approximation is widely used, 3D models have been also proposed to better take into account the basin geometry. A common nonlinear approach to this 3D problem consists in modeling the basin as a set of right rectangular prisms with prescribed density contrast, whose depths are the unknowns. Then, the problem is iteratively solved via local optimization techniques from an initial model computed using some simplifications or being estimated using prior geophysical models. Nevertheless, this kind of approach is highly dependent on the prior information that is used, and lacks from a correct solution appraisal (nonlinear uncertainty analysis). In this paper, we use the family of global Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizers for the 3D gravity inversion and model appraisal of the solution that is adopted for basement relief estimation in sedimentary basins. Synthetic and real cases are illustrated, showing that robust results are obtained. Therefore, PSO seems to be a very good alternative for 3D gravity inversion and uncertainty assessment of basement relief when used in a sampling while optimizing approach. That way important geological questions can be answered probabilistically in order to perform risk assessment in the decisions that are made.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martorana, R</author><author>Capizzi, P</author><author>D’Alessandro, A</author><author>Luzio, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of different sets of array configurations for multichannel 2D ERT acquisition</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>34-48</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>2D</keyword><keyword>Arrays</keyword><keyword>Multichannel</keyword><keyword>Multiple gradient</keyword><keyword>Resistivity</keyword><keyword>Resolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.12.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306425</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Traditional electrode arrays such Wenner-Schlumberger or dipole-dipole are still widely used thanks to their well-known properties but the array configurations are generally not optimized for multi-channel resistivity measures.

Synthetic datasets relating to four different arrays, dipole-dipole (DD), pole-dipole (PD), Wenner-Schlumberger (WS) and a modified version of multiple gradient (MG), have been made for a systematic comparison between 2D resistivity models and their inverted images. Different sets of array configurations generated from simple combinations of geometric parameters (potential dipole lengths and dipole separation factors) were tested with synthetic and field data sets, even considering the influence of errors and the acquisition velocity. The purpose is to establish array configurations capable to provide reliable results but, at the same time, not involving excessive survey costs, even linked to the acquiring time and therefore to the number of current dipoles used.

For DD, PD and WS arrays a progression of different datasets were considered increasing the number of current dipoles trying to get about the same amount of measures. A multi-coverage MG array configuration is proposed by increasing the lateral coverage and so the number of current dipoles. Noise simulating errors both on the electrode positions and on the electric potential was added.

The array configurations have been tested on field data acquired in the landfill site of Bellolampo (Palermo, Italy), to detect and locate the leachate plumes and to identify the HDPE bottom of the landfill.

The inversion results were compared using a quantitative analysis of data misfit, relative model resolution and model misfit. The results show that the trends of the first two parameters are linked on the array configuration and that a cumulative analysis of these parameters can help to choose the best array configuration in order to obtain a good resolution and reliability of a survey, according to generally short acquisition times.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jinho</author><author>Lee, Kang-Hyun</author><author>Seo, Hyungjoon</author><author>Ryu, Jinwoo</author><author>Lee, In-Mo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of induced electrical polarization to identify soft ground/fractured rock conditions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>63-72</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>Chargeability</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>Fractured rock</keyword><keyword>Induced polarization</keyword><keyword>Soft ground</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2016.12.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985116306668</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This study attempted to evaluate the role and effectiveness of induced polarization (IP) along with electrical resistivity to identify soft ground/fractured rock. Theoretical studies as well as laboratory-scale experiments were conducted for this purpose. The theoretical study involved deriving the functional relationship between chargeability and influential variables. This was followed by performing a sensitivity analysis using the derived relationship to reveal that the size of narrow pores (r1) exerted the greatest influence on the chargeability followed by the salinity of the pore water (C0). In the laboratory test, a small-scale fractured rock zone was modeled using sandstone as a parent rock. The chargeability and resistivity were measured by changing the size of the joint aperture filled with tap water and/or sea water, the location of the fractured zone, and the thickness of the soil layer in a soil-rock multi-layered ground. The experimental study modeled the jointed zone between competent sandstone layers and indicated that the chargeability was mostly controlled by the size of the narrow pore (r1) of the surface sandstone and not by the porosity of the jointed zone. Hence, it was concluded that the chargeability did not significantly depend on the fractured characteristics of the jointed rock. It could be difficult to clearly distinguish as to whether the low resistivity value is caused by the sea water intrusion or by the increase in porosity of the fractured ground. However, the IP exploration can be effectively utilized to identify sea water intrusion since the chargeability decreased as the salinity of pore water increased. The experimental study on a soil-rock multi-layered ground indicated that the measured chargeability was controlled by the percentage of current flow that passed through the competent rock as well as by the narrow pore size of the rock itself. In conclusion, the ground condition could be easily identified by measuring the IP in conjunction with the electrical resistivity, and this increased the reliability of identifying the existence of sea water, layered ground, and/or the fractured rock.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sapia, Vincenzo</author><author>Baccheschi, Paola</author><author>Villani, Fabio</author><author>Taroni, Matteo</author><author>Marchetti, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multidisciplinary geophysical approach to map a disposal site: The Ponza island case study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>264-274</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Capacitive coupled resistivity data</keyword><keyword>Disposal site</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Magnetometry</keyword><keyword>Ponza</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.02.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117301301</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and magnetometric surveys are extensively used for environmental investigations of uncontrolled landfills, where the presence of waste with potential contaminants and metal objects requires a detailed characterization and monitoring of their subsurface location. Capacitively-coupled resistivity (CCR) measurements applied for similar environmental studies are far less used. In this study, we show the results and discuss the advantages of a combined application of ERT, CCR and magnetometric surveys applied to the characterization of the disposal site of Mt. Pagliaro, in the island of Ponza (central Italy). The survey area is located on volcanic deposits, which characterize the low resistive geological bedrock. We acquired four CCR profiles and five ERT profiles in addition to a magnetic survey covering a total area of about 7000 m2. The recovered smooth resistivity models suggest the presence of a shallow resistive layer (ρ &amp;gt; 75 Ωm) of variable thickness (2.0–6.0 m), overlying a relatively low-resistive layer, which we interpret as the electrical response of the volcanic bedrock. This interpretation is supported by few shallow boreholes and field observation in the northern part of the landfill area. The magnetic maps show three suspicious dipolar magnetic anomalies, probably ascribed to the presence of a high concentration of buried ferrous waste. Several small-scale dipolar anomalies have been interpreted as due to the presence of sparse and shallow metal objects within the waste material. Due to the resistivity models' smoothness, to improve the characterization of the interface between the bedrock and the waste material we performed a statistical analysis of the resistivity data. Following the philosophy of the steepest gradient method, we found a significative change in resistivity computed on an averaged depth resistivity function of the ERT data. Accordingly, we classify two distinct units: a) an upper unit, with resistivity &amp;gt; 75 Ωm, which we assigned to the coarse waste and dry soil materials; and b) a lower unit, with resistivity &amp;lt; 75 Ωm, which we assigned to the volcanic deposits. We chose the 75 Ωm value as representative of the top-bedrock\waste interface and we interpolated this boundary from both the ERT and the CCR profiles to reconstruct a smooth 3D representation of the top bedrock within the landfill area. This allowed us to evaluate the total volume of the waste material to be about 35,000 m3.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Özel, Sevda</author><author>Yılmaz, Ali</author><author>Emin Candansayar, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The examination of the spread of the leachates coming out of a solid waste disposal area on the ground with geophysical and geochemical methods (Sivas, Turkey)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>40-49</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>2D, 3D, inversion</keyword><keyword>Apparent electromagnetic conductivity</keyword><keyword>DCR</keyword><keyword>Disposal area</keyword><keyword>Heavy metal</keyword><keyword>Leachate</keyword><keyword>Pollution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.01.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300356</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
This study has been conducted in the irregular solid waste disposal area in the city of Sivas. The pollution spread formed by the leachates coming out of the disposal area has been examined with geophysical and geochemical works in this study. For this reason, the spread of the leachate pollution expanding in different geological units at both sides of a creek on the ground has been examined. For this purpose, the pollution spread has been examined with the methods of Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) and Electromagnetic Conductivity (EMC) and soil analyses. In the DCR method, 2D inversion of each sounding-profile datum measured alongside the lines parallel to each other and 3D inversion of the data measured in all the lines have been used in the interpretations. Apparent conductivity map has been attained from EMC measurements. The results of heavy metal analyses in the soil samples taken alongside the Haçin Creek have been assessed with the Spider diagram method. It has been determined that the flow of the leachate from geophysical models is in a SE direction and towards Kızılırmak and it continues vertically deeper than 4 m. In addition, it has been understood that the flow direction of the leachate is inspected by the geological structures. It has been understood from the geochemical results that the pollution in the soil stems from the leachate. In this way, it has been observed that the underground and surface water resources in the territory are under the threat of the pollution occurring due to the leachate.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nazaruddin, Dony Adriansyah</author><author>Amiruzan, Zafirah Sakinah</author><author>Hussin, Hamzah</author><author>Jafar, Mohamad Taufiq Mohd</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated geological and multi-electrode resistivity surveys for groundwater investigation in Kampung Rahmat village and its vicinity, Jeli district, Kelantan, Malaysia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>23-32</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Aquifer</keyword><keyword>Geological survey</keyword><keyword>Groundwater exploration</keyword><keyword>Jeli district</keyword><keyword>Kelantan</keyword><keyword>Multi-electrode resistivity method</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.01.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300344</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
The integration of geological and multi-electrode resistivity surveys has been carried out in Kampung Rahmat village and its vicinity, in Jeli district, Kelantan, Malaysia as part of the groundwater resources exploration for rural water supply. A geological survey in the study area has shown that the area consists of some topographic units: mountainous area, hilly area, and low-lying to undulating area. The study area is lithologically composed of granitic rocks (megacrystic biotite granite porphyry) overlain by Quaternary alluvial deposits (with weathered granite). For the multi-electrode resistivity survey, the Schlumberger array with a maximum electrode spread of 200 m was conducted by employing three resistivity survey lines, where data were collected by using the ABEM Terrameter SAS 4000 and ABEM LUND ES464 electrode selector system, and processed by using RES2DINV software. The images were presented in the form of two-dimensional (2D) resistivity profiles providing a clear view of the distribution of granitic rock basement and alluvial deposits (with the weathered granite) as well as potential groundwater zones. The results show that the study area has potential groundwater resources existing in the alluvium which become the unconfined aquifers. The combination between these two methods is reliable and successful in identifying potentially favorable zones for obtaining groundwater in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maurya, P K</author><author>Rønde, V K</author><author>Fiandaca, G</author><author>Balbarini, N</author><author>Auken, E</author><author>Bjerg, P L</author><author>Christiansen, A V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detailed landfill leachate plume mapping using 2D and 3D electrical resistivity tomography - with correlation to ionic strength measured in screens</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>138</volume><keywords><keyword>Hydrogeophysics</keyword><keyword>Ionic strength</keyword><keyword>Landfill</keyword><keyword>Large scale 3D ERT</keyword><keyword>Leachate plume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2017.01.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926985117300575</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract
Leaching of organic and inorganic contamination from landfills is a serious environmental problem as surface water and aquifers are affected. In order to assess these risks and investigate the migration of leachate from the landfill, 2D and large scale 3D electrical resistivity tomography were used at a heavily contaminated landfill in Grindsted, Denmark. The inverted 2D profiles describe both the variations along the groundwater flow as well as the plume extension across the flow directions. The 3D inversion model shows the variability in the low resistivity anomaly pattern corresponding to differences in the ionic strength of the landfill leachate. Chemical data from boreholes agree well with the observations indicating a leachate plume which gradually sinks and increases in size while migrating from the landfill in the groundwater flow direction. Overall results show that the resistivity method has been very successful in delineating the landfill leachate plume and that good correlation exists between the resistivity model and leachate ionic strength.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Mark R.</author><author>Buda, Anthony R.</author><author>Singha, Kamini</author><author>Folmar, Gordon J.</author><author>Elliott, Herschel A.</author><author>Schmidt, John P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging Hydrological Processes in Headwater Riparian Seeps with Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27618484</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12461</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Delineating hydrologic and pedogenic factors influencing groundwater flow in riparian zones is central in understanding pathways of water and nutrient transport. In this study, we combined two-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) (depth of investigation approximately 2 m) with hydrometric monitoring to examine hydrological processes in the riparian area of FD-36, a small (0.4 km2) agricultural headwater basin in the Valley and Ridge region of east-central Pennsylvania. We selected two contrasting study sites, including a seep with groundwater discharge and an adjacent area lacking such seepage. Both sites were underlain by a fragipan at 0.6 m. We then monitored changes in electrical resistivity, shallow groundwater, and nitrate-N concentrations as a series of storms transitioned the landscape from dry to wet conditions. Time-lapse ERI revealed different resistivity patterns between seep and non-seep areas during the study period. Notably, the seep displayed strong resistivity reductions (∼60%) along a vertically aligned region of the soil profile, which coincided with strong upward hydraulic gradients recorded in a grid of nested piezometers (0.2- and 0.6-m depth). These patterns suggested a hydraulic connection between the seep and the nitrate-rich shallow groundwater system below the fragipan, which enabled groundwater and associated nitrate-N to discharge through the fragipan to the surface. In contrast, time-lapse ERI indicated no such connections in the non-seep area, with infiltrated rainwater presumably perched above the fragipan. Results highlight the value of pairing time-lapse ERI with hydrometric and water quality monitoring to illuminate possible groundwater and nutrient flow pathways to seeps in headwater riparian areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, Deqiang</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Revil, Andr??</author><author>Zuo, Yi</author><author>Hinton, John</author><author>Ren, Zhiyong Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical Monitoring of Hydrocarbon-Contaminated Soils Remediated with a Bioelectrochemical System</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><volume>50</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/acs.est.6b00535</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Efficient noninvasive techniques are desired for monitoring the remediation process of contaminated soils. We applied the direct current resistivity technique to image conductivity changes in sandbox experiments where two sandy and clayey soils were initially contaminated with diesel hydrocarbon. The experiments were conducted over a 230 day period. The removal of hydrocarbon was enhanced by a bioelectrochemical system (BES) and the electrical potentials of the BES reactors were also monitored during the course of the experiment. We found that the variation in electrical conductivity shown in the tomograms correlate well with diesel removal from the sandy soil, but this is not the case with the clayey soil. The clayey soil is characterized by a larger specific surface area and therefore a larger surface conductivity. In sandy soil, the removal of the diesel and products from degradation leads to an increase in electrical conductivity during the first 69 days. This is expected since diesel is electrically insulating. For both soils, the activity of BES reactors is moderately imaged by the inverted conductivity tomogram of the reactor. An increase in current production by electrochemically active bacteria activity corresponds to an increase in conductivity of the reactor.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Timothy C.</author><author>Versteeg, Roelof J.</author><author>Day-Lewis, Frederick D.</author><author>Major, William</author><author>Lane, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25457440</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12291</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Johnson et al. - 2015 - Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Biostimulation is increasingly used to accelerate microbial remediation of recalcitrant groundwater contaminants. Effective application of biostimulation requires successful emplacement of amendment in the contaminant target zone. Verification of remediation performance requires postemplacement assessment and contaminant monitoring. Sampling-based approaches are expensive and provide low-density spatial and temporal information. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is an effective geophysical method for determining temporal changes in subsurface electrical conductivity. Because remedial amendments and biostimulation-related biogeochemical processes often change subsurface electrical conductivity, ERT can complement and enhance sampling-based approaches for assessing emplacement and monitoring biostimulation-based remediation. Field studies demonstrating the ability of time-lapse ERT to monitor amendment emplacement and behavior were performed during a biostimulation remediation effort conducted at the Department of Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Yard, in Brandywine, Maryland, United States. Geochemical fluid sampling was used to calibrate a petrophysical relation in order to predict groundwater indicators of amendment distribution. The petrophysical relations were field validated by comparing predictions to sequestered fluid sample results, thus demonstrating the potential of electrical geophysics for quantitative assessment of amendment-related geochemical properties. Crosshole radar zero-offset profile and borehole geophysical logging were also performed to augment the data set and validate interpretation. In addition to delineating amendment transport in the first 10 months after emplacement, the time-lapse ERT results show later changes in bulk electrical properties interpreted as mineral precipitation. Results support the use of more cost-effective surface-based ERT in conjunction with limited field sampling to improve spatial and temporal monitoring of amendment emplacement and remediation performance.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Najib, Saliha</author><author>Fadili, Ahmed</author><author>Mehdi, Khalid</author><author>Riss, Joëlle</author><author>Makan, Abdelhadi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contribution of hydrochemical and geoelectrical approaches to investigate salinization process and seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers of Chaouia, Morocco</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.01.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Najib et al. - 2017 - Contribution of hydrochemical and geoelectrical approaches to investigate salinization process and seawater intrus.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bedrosian, Paul A.</author><author>Burton, Bethany L.</author><author>Powers, Michael H.</author><author>Minsley, Burke J.</author><author>Phillips, Jeffrey D.</author><author>Hunter, Lewis E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical investigations of geology and structure at the Martis Creek Dam, Truckee, California</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>ERT</keyword><keyword>Earthen dams</keyword><keyword>Magnetotellurics</keyword><keyword>Martis Creek</keyword><keyword>Seismic methods</keyword><keyword>Truckee Basin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2011.11.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>A recent evaluation of Martis Creek Dam highlighted the potential for dam failure due to either seepage or an earthquake on nearby faults. In 1972, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed this earthen dam, located within the Truckee Basin to the north of Lake Tahoe, CA for water storage and flood control. Past attempts to raise the level of the Martis Creek Reservoir to its design level have been aborted due to seepage at locations downstream, along the west dam abutment, and at the base of the spillway. In response to these concerns, the U.S. Geological Survey has undertaken a comprehensive suite of geophysical investigations aimed at understanding the interplay between geologic structure, seepage patterns, and reservoir and groundwater levels. This paper concerns the geologic structure surrounding Martis Creek Dam and emphasizes the importance of a regional-scale understanding to the interpretation of engineering-scale geophysical data. Our studies reveal a thick package of sedimentary deposits interbedded with Plio-Pleistocene volcanic flows; both the deposits and the flows are covered by glacial outwash. Magnetic field data, seismic tomography models, and seismic reflections are used to determine the distribution and chronology of the volcanic flows. Previous estimates of depth to basement (or the thickness of the interbedded deposits) was 100. m. Magnetotelluric soundings suggest that electrically resistive bedrock may be up to 2500. m deep. Both the Polaris Fault, identified outside of the study area using airborne LiDAR, and the previously unnamed Martis Creek Fault, have been mapped through the dam area using ground and airborne geophysics. Finally, as determined by direct-current resistivity imaging, time-domain electromagnetic sounding, and seismic refraction, the paleotopography of the interface between the sedimentary deposits and the overlying glacial outwash plays a principal role both in controlling groundwater flow and in the distribution of the observed seepage. ?? 2011 .</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crook, N</author><author>Binley, A</author><author>Knight, R</author><author>Robinson, D A</author><author>Zarnetske, J</author><author>Haggerty, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical resistivity imaging of the architecture of substream sediments</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008WR006968</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Crook et al. - 2008 - Electrical resistivity imaging of the architecture of substream sediments.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, Kenneth H</author><author>Ntarlagiannis, Dimitrios</author><author>Slater, Lee D</author><author>Dohnalkova, Alice</author><author>Hubbard, Susan S</author><author>Banfield, Jillian F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical Imaging of Stimulated Microbial Biomineralization</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science &amp;

To obtain high-quality data with an optimized signal-to-noise ratio, a series of data processing techniques were used to obtain the final transient response curves from the field survey data. These steps included movement correction, coordinate transformation, the removal of local noise, data stacking, and signal portion extraction. We performed numerical forward modeling to generate a three-dimensional (3D) resistivity structure model from the GREATEM data. This model was developed from an initial one-dimensional (1D) resistivity structure that was also inverted from the GREATEM field survey data. We modified a 3D electromagnetic forward-modeling scheme based on a finite-difference staggered-grid method and used it to calculate the response of the 3D resistivity model along each survey line. We verified the model by examining the fit of the magnetic-transient responses between field data and the 3D forward-model computed data, the latter of which were convolved with the measured system responses of the corresponding data set. The inverted 3D resistivity structures showed that the GREATEM system has the capability to map resistivity structures as far as 800 m offshore and as deep as 300–350 m underground in coastal areas of relatively shallow seawater depth (5–10 m).</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atekwana, Estella A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for microbial enhanced electrical conductivity in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><volume>31</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>0094-8276</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2004GL021359</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Atekwana - 2004 - Evidence for microbial enhanced electrical conductivity in hydrocarbon-contaminated sediments.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Xue Song</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Magnetic properties and heavy metal pollution of soils in the vicinity of a cement plant, Xuzhou (China)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>73-78</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Cement plant</keyword><keyword>Environmental magnetism</keyword><keyword>Heavy metal</keyword><keyword>Self-organizing map</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>09269851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.08.008</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract This study characterized the magnetic property and levels of heavy metals of the topsoils near a cement plant. The concentrations of five selected heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd) were measured on 32 topsoil samples (0–20 cm) collected near a cement plant via inductively coupled plasma/mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The orders of enrichment factors (EF), on average, were Cd (7.3) &gt; Cu (3) &gt; Zn (2.9) &gt; Pb (2.1), respectively. A self-organizing map (SOM) was applied to the concentrations of heavy metals for “correlation hunting”. Mineral magnetic concentration parameters, such as the specific magnetic susceptibility (χ), susceptibility of anhysteretic remanent magnetization (χARM), saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), together with interparametric ratios (such as IRM− 100mT/SIRM, SIRM/χ, χARM/SIRM) show that ferrimagnetic, superparamagnetic (SP) and multi-domain (MD) minerals dominated the soils. The results of correlation analysis indicate that copper showed a significant correlation with χ, χARM and SIRM but such a relationship with χ, χARM and SIRM was only weakly identified for Zn, Cd and Pb.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McGee, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution marine reflection profiling for engineering and environmental purposes: Part A: Acquiring analogue seismic signals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>271-285</pages><volume>33</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1995</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://McGee -

A total of 46 VES/TEM soundings were acquired in a region of 90 km2 located in the Paraná Sedimentary Basin. This article has two main goals, compare the joint inversion and the single inversion of VES and TEM in two large areas and obtain a new and more precisely geoelectrical model of the Bebedouro region, focusing the exploration in the shallow and deep sedimentary aquifers of the study area. The previous interpretation was based in geoelectrical models obtained by single inversion of the VES and TEM soundings. In this work we present the results with single inversion of VES and TEM sounding inverted by the Curupira Program (Bortolozo and Porsani, 2012) and a new interpretation based in the joint inversion of the both methodologies. The results from joint inversion permit to obtain a more reliable geoelectrical model and serve as an accurate guide to the exploration of groundwater.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halihan, Todd</author><author>Paxton, Stanley</author><author>Graham, Ivy</author><author>Fenstemaker, Thomas</author><author>Riley, Matt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Post-remediation evaluation of a LNAPL site using electrical resistivity imaging</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Monitoring</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Monitoring</full-title></periodical><pages>283</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><isbn>1464-0325</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1039/b416484a</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Halihan et al. - 2005 - Post-remediation evaluation of a LNAPL site using electrical resistivity imaging.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boyce, Joseph</author><author>Reinhardt, Eduard</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Marine magnetic survey of a submerged Roman harbour, Caesarea Maritima, Israel</title><secondary-title>The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology</full-title></periodical><pages>122-136</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>doi: 10.1111/j.1095-9270.2004.010.x</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Boyce, Reinhardt - 2004 - Marine magnetic survey of a submerged Roman harbour, Caesarea Maritima, Israel.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greenhouse, John</author><author>Brewster, Michael</author><author>Schneider, George</author><author>Redman, David</author><author>Annan, Peter</author><author>Olhoeft, Gary</author><author>Lucius, Jeff</author><author>Sander, Kathy</author><author>Mazzella, Aldo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysics and solvents: the Borden experiment</title><secondary-title>The Leading Edge</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Leading Edge</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>1993</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Greenhouse et al. - 1993 - Geophysics and solvents the Borden experiment.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dahlin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil resistivity monitoring of an irrigation experiment</title><secondary-title>Near Surface Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Near Surface Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>18730604</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3997/1873-0604.2013035</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dahlin - 2013 - Soil resistivity monitoring of an irrigation experiment.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Audebert, M</author><author>Clément, R</author><author>Touze-Foltz, N</author><author>Günther, T</author><author>Moreau, S</author><author>Duquennoi, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-lapse ERT interpretation methodology for leachate injection monitoring based on multiple inversions and a clustering strategy (MICS)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>320-333</pages><volume>111</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Clustering</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Hydrodynamics</keyword><keyword>Leachate</keyword><keyword>Time-lapse inversion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.09.024</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Leachate recirculation is a key process in municipal waste landfills functioning as bioreactors. To quantify the water content and to assess the leachate injection system, in-situ methods are required to obtain spatially distributed information, usually electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). This geophysical method is based on the inversion process, which presents two major problems in terms of delimiting the infiltration area. First, it is difficult for ERT users to choose an appropriate inversion parameter set. Indeed, it might not be sufficient to interpret only the optimum model (i.e. the model with the chosen regularisation strength) because it is not necessarily the model which best represents the physical process studied. Second, it is difficult to delineate the infiltration front based on resistivity models because of the smoothness of the inversion results. This paper proposes a new methodology called MICS (multiple inversions and clustering strategy), which allows ERT users to improve the delimitation of the infiltration area in leachate injection monitoring. The MICS methodology is based on (i) a multiple inversion step by varying the inversion parameter values to take a wide range of resistivity models into account and (ii) a clustering strategy to improve the delineation of the infiltration front. In this paper, MICS was assessed on two types of data. First, a numerical assessment allows us to optimise and test MICS for different infiltration area sizes, contrasts and shapes. Second, MICS was applied to a field data set gathered during leachate recirculation on a bioreactor.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rossi, Pekka M</author><author>Ala-aho, Pertti</author><author>Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa</author><author>Kløve, Bjørn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Groundwater–surface water interaction between an esker aquifer and a drained fen</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>52-60</pages><volume>432-433</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>00221694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.02.026</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Rossi et al. -

These data are sensitive to fluids, melts, and other orogenic indicators, and thus provide a valuable complement to other components of EarthScope. We present and interpret results of 3-D MT data inversion from 325 sites acquired from 2006–2011 to provide a regional scale view of electrical resistivity from the middle crust to nearly the mantle transition zone, covering an area from NW Washington to NW Colorado. Beneath the active extensional subprovinces in the south-central region, on average we see a resistive upper crust, and then extensive areas of low resistivity in the lower crust and uppermost mantle. Further below, much of the upper half of the upper mantle appears moderately resistive, then subsequently the lower upper mantle becomes moderately conductive. This column suggests a dynamic process of moderately hydrated and fertile deeper upper mantle upwelling during extension, intersection of that material with the damp solidus causing dehydration and melting, and upward exodus of generated mafic melts to pond and exsolve saline fluids near Moho levels. Lithosphere here is very thin. To the east and northeast, thick sections of resistive lithosphere are imaged under the Wyoming and Medicine Hat Cratons. These are punctuated with numerous electrically conductive sutures presumably containing graphitic or sulfide-bearing meta-sediments deeply underthrust and emplaced during ancient collisions. Below Cascadia, the subducting Juan de Fuca and Gorda lithosphere appears highly resistive. Suspected oceanic lithosphere relicts in the central NW part of the model domain also are resistive, including the accreted “Siletzia” terrane beneath the Coast Ranges and Columbia Embayment, and the seismically fast “slab curtain” beneath eastern Idaho interpreted by others as stranded Farallon plate. Upwelling of deep fluid or melt in the Cascade volcanic arc region manifests as conductive features at several scales. These include quasi-horizontal conductive patches under the arc and fore-arc, likely denoting fluids evolved via breakdown of hydrous minerals in the current down-going slab. In the backarc, low resistivities concentrate in “plumes” connecting into a deeper aesthenospheric layer to the east, consistent with subduction-driven upwelling of hot, hydrated or melted, aesthenospheric mantle. Low resistivities ( &lt; 10 Ω m ) deep beneath the stable cratons suggest higher levels of hydration there, and/or influence of poorly resolved structures outside the array.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhlemann, Sebastian</author><author>Wilkinson, Paul B</author><author>Chambers, Jonathan E</author><author>Maurer, Hansruedi</author><author>Merritt, Andrew J</author><author>Gunn, David A</author><author>Meldrum, Philip I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpolation of landslide movements to improve the accuracy of 4D geoelectrical monitoring</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>93-105</pages><volume>121</volume><keywords><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Landslide</keyword><keyword>Monitoring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.07.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Uhlemann et al. - 2015 - Interpolation of landslide movements to improve the accuracy of 4D geoelectrical monitoring.webarchive</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Measurement sensors permanently installed on landslides will inevitably change their position over time due to mass movements. To interpret and correct the recorded data, these movements have to be determined. This is especially important in the case of geoelectrical monitoring, where incorrect sensor positions produce strong artefacts in the resulting resistivity models. They may obscure real changes, which could indicate triggering mechanisms for landslide failure or reactivation. In this paper we introduce a methodology to interpolate movements from a small set of sparsely distributed reference points to a larger set of electrode locations. Within this methodology we compare three interpolation techniques, i.e., a piecewise planar, bi-linear spline, and a kriging based interpolation scheme. The performance of these techniques is tested on a synthetic and a real-data example, showing a recovery rate of true movements to about 1% and 10% of the electrode spacing, respectively. The significance for applying the proposed methodology is demonstrated by inverse modelling of 4D electrical resistivity tomography data, where it is shown that by correcting for sensor movements corresponding artefacts can virtually be removed and true resistivity changes be imaged.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Carlo, Lorenzo</author><author>Perri, Maria Teresa</author><author>Caputo, Maria Clementina</author><author>Deiana, Rita</author><author>Vurro, Michele</author><author>Cassiani, Giorgio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of a dismissed landfill via electrical resistivity tomography and mise-à-la-masse method</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>98</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Confinement</keyword><keyword>Electrical methods</keyword><keyword>Forward modeling</keyword><keyword>Landfill</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.07.010</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Electrical resistivity methods are widely used for environmental applications, and they are particularly useful for the characterization and monitoring of sites where the presence of contamination requires a thorough understanding of the location and movement of water, that can act as a carrier of solutes. One such application is landfill studies, where the strong electrical contrasts between waste, leachate and surrounding formations make electrical methods a nearly ideal tool for investigation. In spite of the advantages, however, electrical investigation of landfills poses also challenges, both logistical and interpretational. This paper presents the results of a study conducted on a dismissed landfill, close to the city of Corigliano d'Otranto, in the Apulia region (Southern Italy). The landfill is located in an abandoned quarry, that was subsequently re-utilized about thirty years ago as a site for urban waste disposal. The waste was thought to be more than 20 m thick, and the landfill bottom was expected to be confined with an HDPE (high-density poli-ethylene) liner. During the digging operations performed to build a nearby new landfill, leachate was found, triggering an in-depth investigation including also non-invasive methods. The principal goal was to verify whether the leachate is indeed confined, and to what extent, by the HDPE liner. We performed both surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and mise-à-la-masse (MALM) surveys, facing the severe challenges posed by the rugged terrain of the abandoned quarry complex. A conductive body, probably associated with leachate, was found as deep as 40 m below the current landfill surface i.e. at a depth much larger than the expected 20 m thickness of waste. Given the logistical difficulties that limit the geometry of acquisition, we utilized synthetic forward modeling in order to confirm/dismiss interpretational hypotheses emerging from the ERT and MALM results. This integration between measurements and modeling helped narrow the alternative interpretations and strengthened the confidence in results, confirming the effectiveness of non-invasive methods in landfill investigation and the importance of modeling in the interpretation of geophysical results.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ikard, S J</author><author>Revil, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Self-potential monitoring of a thermal pulse advecting through a preferential flow path</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>34-49</pages><volume>519</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>00221694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.07.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ikard, Revil -

However, ERT is rarely used at DNAPL sites due to the complexity of the DNAPL target coupled with the inherent limitations of traditional (surface and cross-hole) ERT configurations. Horizontal boreholes are being increasingly used in remedial strategies at contaminated field sites. This paper presents a novel surface-to-horizontal borehole (S2HB) ERT configuration for DNAPL site investigations. This array configuration is combined with four-dimensional (4D) inversion methods (applied on two-dimensional (2D) time-lapse monitoring datasets) to explore the potential benefit of S2HB ERT for mapping the spatial and temporal evolution of DNAPL mass during remediation. A field scale DNAPL remediation scenario was first simulated by a coupled DNAPL-ERT model. This demonstrated that S2HB ERT may provide significant improvements over surface ERT, particularly for delineating DNAPL mass removal at depth. A laboratory experiment was then performed to validate the S2HB ERT approach in a physical system. The experiment confirmed that 4D S2HB ERT provides improved time-lapse monitoring of NAPL changes. Confidence in the ERT responses obtained from the experiment was increased by direct comparison to the actual distribution of NAPL mapped by excavation. Independent simulation of the experiment with the DNAPL-ERT model demonstrated that the model is reliable for simulating real systems. This initial study demonstrates significantly improved resistivity imaging with surface-to-horizontal borehole ERT and its potential as a non-destructive site characterization tool for mapping DNAPL mass changes during remediation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adams, Kenneth D</author><author>Sada, Donald W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Surface water hydrology and geomorphic characterization of a playa lake system: Implications for monitoring the effects of climate change</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>92-102</pages><volume>510</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Black Rock Playa</keyword><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Geomorphology</keyword><keyword>Hydrology</keyword><keyword>Landsat</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.12.018</electronic-resource-num><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Auken, Esben</author><author>Doetsch, Joseph</author><author>Fiandaca, Gianluca</author><author>Christiansen, Anders Vest</author><author>Gazoty, Aurélie</author><author>Cahill, Aaron Graham</author><author>Jakobsen, Rasmus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging subsurface migration of dissolved CO2 in a shallow aquifer using 3-D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><issue>0</issue><keywords/><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.11.011</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Contamination of groundwater by leaking CO2 is a potential risk of carbon sequestration. With the help of a field experiment in western Denmark, we investigate to what extent surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) can detect and image dissolved CO2 in a shallow aquifer. For this purpose, we injected CO2 at a depth of 5 and 10 m and monitored its migration using 320 electrodes on a 126 m × 25 m surface grid. A fully automated acquisition system continuously collected data and uploaded it into an online database. The large amount of data allows for time-series analysis using geostatistical techniques for noise estimation and data interpolation to compensate for intermittent instrument failure. We estimate a time-dependent noise level for each ERT configuration, taking data variation and measurement frequency into account. A baseline inversion reveals the geology at the site consisting of aeolian and glacial sands near the surface and marine sands below 10 m depth. 3-D time-lapse ERT inversions clearly image the dissolved CO2 plume with decreased electrical resistivity values. We can image the geochemical changes induced by the dissolved CO2 until the end of the acquisition, 120 days after the injection start. During these 120 days, the CO2 migrates about 25 m in the expected groundwater flow direction. Water electrical conductivity (EC) sampling using small screens in 29 wells allows for very good verification of the ERT results. Water EC and ERT results generally agree very well, with the water sampling showing some fine-scale variations that cannot be resolved by the ERT. The ERT images have their strength in outlining the plume’s shape in three dimensions and in being able to image the plume outside the well field. These results highlight the potential for imaging dissolved CO2 using non-intrusive surface electrical resistivity tomography.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandberg, Stewart</author><author>Slater, Lee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical monitoring through a tidal cycle at Cresent Beach State Park, Maine</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental and Engineering Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>165-174</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sandberg, Slater - 2001 - Geophysical monitoring through a tidal cycle at Cresent Beach State Park, Maine.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Revil, A</author><author>Glover, P W J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nature of surface electrical conductivity in natural sands, sandstones, and clays</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>691-694</pages><volume>25</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Revil, Glover - 1998 - Nature of surface electrical conductivity in natural sands, sandstones, and clays.webarchive</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zarroca, Mario</author><author>Linares, Rogelio</author><author>Velásquez-López, Patricio C</author><author>Roqué, Carles</author><author>Rodríguez, Roberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to a tailings dam project for artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Zaruma-Portovelo, Ecuador</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>103-113</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Artisanal gold mining</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI)</keyword><keyword>Tailings dam</keyword><keyword>Weathered granitic massif</keyword><keyword>Zaruma-Portovelo Mining District</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.11.022</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Zarroca et al. - 2015 - Application of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to a tailings dam project for artisanal and small-sca.webarchive</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract Thanks to advances in geoelectrical resistivity method over the past two decades, researchers can now gather massive geophysical data sets encompassing long distances and depths, at reasonable cost. The enhanced resolution and spatial coverage of these techniques make them, now, very attractive for use in geological engineering applications, an area for which they were previously charged to be unsuitable. The study shows the capability of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to identify key subsoil features that might affect a future tailings dam slated for construction at the Zaruma-Portovelo Mining District, Ecuador. The ERI profiles were gathered and processed with the aim of obtaining resistivity images of a sufficiently resolution for geotechnical use. A geophysical model was created based on these images. The resistivity images were calibrated according to geomorphological, hydrogeological and geotechnical data in order to translate geophysical information into rational geological information. The ERI results, supported by the geomorphological and geotechnical work, suggested that the rock massif is composed of weathering horizons of different rock qualities, slopes are affected by sliding surfaces and these features exert a control on the groundwater flow. These results indicated that the original site selected to construct the dam dike was susceptible to land sliding and an alternative construction site was suggested. Based on the same results, a geomorphological–hydrogeological conceptual model for layered weathered granitic massif in mountainous areas was also proposed.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mansoor, Nasser</author><author>Slater, Lee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aquatic electrical resistivity imaging of shallow-water wetlands</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><pages>F211-F221</pages><volume>72</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.2750667</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mansoor, Slater - 2007 - Aquatic electrical resistivity imaging of shallow-water wetlands.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mao, D</author><author>Revil, A</author><author>Hort, R D</author><author>Munakata-Marr, J</author><author>Atekwana, E A</author><author>Kulessa, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resistivity and self-potential tomography applied to groundwater remediation and contaminant plumes: Sandbox and field experiments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>530</volume><keywords><keyword>GI</keyword><keyword>Water Science and Technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.09.031</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mao et al. - 2015 - Resistivity and self-potential tomography applied to groundwater remediation and contaminant plumes Sandbox and fiel.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slater, Lee</author><author>Reeve, Andrew</author><author>Glaser, Danney</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving understanding of peatland hydrogeology using electrical geophysics</title></titles><periodical/><volume>SAGEEP 200</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2001</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Slater, Reeve, Glaser - 2001 - Improving understanding of peatland hydrogeology using electrical geophysics.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Auken, Esben</author><author>Doetsch, Joseph</author><author>Fiandaca, Gianluca</author><author>Christiansen, Anders Vest</author><author>Gazoty, Aurélie</author><author>Cahill, Aaron Graham</author><author>Jakobsen, Rasmus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging subsurface migration of dissolved CO2 in a shallow aquifer using 3-D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>31-41</pages><volume>101</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>CO2</keyword><keyword>ERT</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity</keyword><keyword>Groundwater</keyword><keyword>Monitoring</keyword><keyword>Time-lapse inversion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>09269851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.11.011</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Contamination of groundwater by leaking CO2 is a potential risk of carbon sequestration.

In this study, measurements of electrical conductivity were accomplished with electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and EM38 to develop multiple datasets for defining spatiotemporal moisture content variations and estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity under natural conditions in an experimental site located in Lisbon, Portugal. In addition, EM38 capability in monitoring electrical conductivity variations in comparison with ERT method was examined. In order to achieve these objectives, appropriate relationships were derived based on determination of experimental curve resistivity vs. degree of saturation by in-situ investigation to convert electrical resistivity maps inferred from ERT and EM38 data to moisture content distribution maps. In addition, the surface temperature variations during the experiment were measured and the effects of the temperature variations were removed by assuming 2% change in electrical resistivity per °C change in temperature. The conducted experiment proves that the soil is fairly homogenous and semi-pervious sediment and the spatiotemporal moisture content variations during the experiment barely exceed 10%. Our calculations constrain the range of saturated hydraulic conductivity to be 3–9 (cm/day) range.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aal, Gamal Z Abdel</author><author>Slater, Lee D</author><author>Atekwana, Estella A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Induced-polarization measurements on unconsolidated sediments from a site of active hydrocarbon biodegradation</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><pages>H13-H24</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.2187760</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Aal, Slater, Atekwana -

The Ghadames Basin which also occurs in eastern Algeria and northwestern Libya is one of the most prolific hydrocarbon producers in North Africa with several of the largest oil fields occurring along its northern boundary. The Ghadames Basin was formed during a series of tectonic events ranging from the Early Paleozoic to the Early Cenozoic. These tectonic events produced a basin in southern Tunisia that has a complex basement configuration which is not completely known. A residual gravity anomaly map constructed using polynomial trend surfaces, and vertical and horizontal gravity derivative maps indicate that the northern boundary contains a series of maxima and minima anomalies that trend in two prominent directions: northeast–southwest and east–west. The horizontal and vertical derivative gravity anomaly maps indicate that the width of the basement structures range between 10 and 20 km in width. Three-dimensional (3D) Euler deconvolution and 3D forward modeling constrained by well data, one seismic reflection profile and remote sensing data confirm the width of the basement structures and indicates that the depth of basin varies between 1.5 and 5 km, with deeper sections in general more numerous in the southern sections of the boundary. The gravity analysis constrained by the seismic reflection profile and well data implies that the basement topography may have been formed during the Pan African and/or late Mesozoic rifting. However, additional seismic reflection and well data are needed to confirm this conclusion. The discovery of the numerous basement structures suggests that there may exist additional hydrocarbon traps within the northern boundary of the Ghadames Basin.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rucker, D</author><author>Fink, J</author><author>Loke, M</author><author>Myers, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Environmental Monitoring of Leaks using Time Lapsed Long Electrode Electrical Resistivity</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Washington River Protection Solutions</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Rucker et al. - 2009 - Environmental Monitoring of Leaks using Time Lapsed Long Electrode Electrical Resistivity.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Chich-Hou</author><author>Lee, Wei-Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using direct current resistivity sounding and geostatistics to aid in hydrogeological studies in the Choshuichi Alluvial Fan, Taiwan</title><secondary-title>Ground Water</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ground Water</full-title></periodical><pages>165-173</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Yang, Lee - 2002 - Using direct current resistivity sounding and geostatistics to aid in hydrogeological studies in the Choshuichi Alluv.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greenwood, Jason</author><author>Rucker, Dale</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Marine resistivity survey of the Panama Canal</title><secondary-title>Fast times</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Fast times</full-title></periodical><pages>45-47</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Greenwood, Rucker - 2009 - Marine resistivity survey of the Panama Canal.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>de Castro, David Lopes</author><author>Filho, Francisco Pinheiro Lima</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of collapsed paleocave systems using GPR attributes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>3D Geometry</keyword><keyword>Collapsed paleocaves</keyword><keyword>GPR</keyword><keyword>Potiguar Basin</keyword><keyword>mathematical attributes</keyword></keywords><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.01.007</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Although the origin and evolution of karst collapsed paleocave systems are active topics of research, the characterization of the 3D internal geometry of these systems still requires further investigation. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey was performed to mapping subsurface collapsed paleocaves in carbonate sequence in the Cretaceous Potiguar Basin (northeastern Brazil), which can be considered analogous to hydrocarbon reservoir. To better identify and delineate the subsurface collapsed paleocaves several attributes, i.e. mathematical operators, such as instantaneous frequency, amplitude, and attributes related to geometry of the reflectors, were applied to synthetic and real GPR data. The resulting radargrams helped the characterization of the electromagnetic response pattern of the collapsed paleocaves with respect to the host limestone and allowed an improved detection of the numerous fractures and clast contacts caused by the collapse of the ceiling and walls of the paleocaves. The GPR attributes also provide an enhanced three-dimensionally imaging of the paleocave system internal geometry. Furthermore, changes in electrical impedance could be correlated with variations in porosity in the collapsed paleocaves and their bedrock. These results are consistent with petrological analysis of rock samples collected in the study area.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daily, William</author><author>Ramirez, Abelardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electrical imaging of engineered hydraulic barriers</title><secondary-title>Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>83-94</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Daily, Ramirez - 2002 - Electrical imaging of engineered hydraulic barriers.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rau, Gabriel C</author><author>Andersen, Martin S</author><author>McCallum, Andrew M</author><author>Roshan, Hamid</author><author>Acworth, R Ian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat as a tracer to quantify water flow in near-surface sediments</title><secondary-title>Earth-Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth-Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Groundwater Hydrology</keyword><keyword>Heat as a tracer</keyword><keyword>Hydrogeology</keyword><keyword>conduction heat transport</keyword><keyword>convection heat transport</keyword><keyword>temperature data</keyword></keywords><isbn>0012-8252</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.10.015</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract The dynamic distribution of thermal conditions present in saturated near-surface sediments have been widely utilised to quantify the flow of water. A rapidly increasing number of papers demonstrate that heat as a tracer is becoming an integral part of the toolbox used to investigate water flow in the environment. We summarise the existing body of research investigating natural and induced heat transport, and analyse the progression in fundamental and natural process understanding through the qualitative and quantitative use of heat as a tracer. Heat transport research in engineering applications partly overlaps with heat tracing research in the earth sciences but is more advanced in the fundamental understanding. Combining the findings from both areas can enhance our knowledge of the heat transport processes and highlight where research is needed. Heat tracing relies upon the mathematical heat transport equation which is subject to certain assumptions that are often neglected. This review reveals that, despite the research efforts to date, the capability of the Fourier-model applied to conductive-convective heat transport in water saturated natural materials has not yet been thoroughly tested. However, this is a prerequisite for accurate and meaningful heat transport modelling with the purpose of increasing our understanding of flow processes at different scales. This review reveals several knowledge gaps that impose significant limitations on practical applications of heat as a tracer of water flow. The review can be used as a guide for further research directions on the fundamental as well as the practical aspects of heat transport on various scales from the lab to the field.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bonomo, Néstor</author><author>Bullo, Darío</author><author>Villela, Almendra</author><author>Osella, Ana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ground-penetrating radar investigation of the cylindrical pedestal of a monument</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Cylindrical structure</keyword><keyword>GPR</keyword><keyword>Pedestal</keyword><keyword>Variable-offset circular profiles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.12.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Bonomo et al. - 2015 - Ground-penetrating radar investigation of the cylindrical pedestal of a monument.webarchive</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract We describe a GPR methodology used to investigate the internal structure of three consecutive sections of the cylindrical pedestal of a monument that had to be disassembled for relocation. We acquired constant-offset circular profiles and non-standard variable-offset profiles at different heights along the pedestal. In the raw data sections, the reflections of interest were hidden by significant environmental noise with frequencies that overlapped those of the transmitted pulses and varied from trace to trace. We successfully eliminated the noise by iteratively fitting sinusoidal waves in different x–t windows and by subtracting the results from the traces. The resulting sections were interesting because they exhibited numerous and varied reflections. We analysed these sections using a combination of procedures previously used for cylindrical structures and other procedures adapted from protocols commonly used for plane semi-spaces. In particular, we evaluated the information provided by the variable-offset profiles and determined how it complemented the information obtained from the constant-offset profiles. In the variable-offset profiles, multiple reflections produced at the cylinder–air interface were reliably distinguished up to the fifth-order of reflection by taking advantage of their distinctive shapes. In the constant-offset profiles, this information was used to distinguish the multiples from possible signals of internal structures or their multiples and from unwanted signals produced by the GPR system, which can be confused with the multiples. We also considered obtaining the propagation velocity across the structure with a high degree of reliability by including the travel times of higher-order multiples in the calculations. Fitting of the theoretical curves, migration and polar representations allowed for a thorough interpretation of the reflectors present in the structures. Probable reinforcement bars, circular ties, natural veins of the material and reflectors located in nearby sections of the monument were identified. The continuity of the reflectors along the pedestal was determined. On this basis, an efficient disassembly and relocation plan for the monument was designed and performed.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atekwana, Estella</author><author>Sauck, William</author><author>Werkema Jr, Douglas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of a complex refinery groundwater contamination plume using multiple geoelectric methods</title></titles><periodical/><volume>SAGEEP 199</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Atekwana, Sauck, Werkema Jr - 1998 - Characterization of a complex refinery groundwater contamination plume using multiple geoelectric m.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atekwana, E A</author><author>Werkema, D D</author><author>Atekwana, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biogeophysics: The effects of microbial processes on geophysical properties of the shallow subsurface</title><secondary-title>Applied Hydrogeophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Hydrogeophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><publisher>Springer Verlag</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tosti, Fabio</author><author>Patriarca, Claudio</author><author>Slob, Evert</author><author>Benedetto, Andrea</author><author>Lambot, Sébastien</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clay content evaluation in soils through GPR signal processing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>69-80</pages><volume>97</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Clay detection</keyword><keyword>Full-waveform inversion</keyword><keyword>Ground-penetrating radar</keyword><keyword>Rayleigh scattering</keyword><keyword>Road pavement</keyword><keyword>Signal picking</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2013.04.006</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract The mechanical behavior of soils is partly affected by their clay content, which arises some important issues in many fields of employment, such as civil and environmental engineering, geology, and agriculture. This work focuses on pavement engineering, although the method applies to other fields of interest. Clay content in bearing courses of road pavement frequently causes damages and defects (e.g., cracks, deformations, and ruts). Therefore, the road safety and operability decreases, directly affecting the increase of expected accidents. In this study, different ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods and techniques were used to non-destructively investigate the clay content in sub-asphalt compacted soils. Experimental layout provided the use of typical road materials, employed for road bearing courses construction. Three types of soils classified by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as A1, A2, and A3 were used and adequately compacted in electrically and hydraulically isolated test boxes. Percentages of bentonite clay were gradually added, ranging from 2% to 25% by weight. Analyses were carried out for each clay content using two different GPR instruments. A pulse radar with ground-coupled antennae at 500 MHz centre frequency and a vector network analyzer spanning the 1–3 GHz frequency range were used. Signals were processed in both time and frequency domains, and the consistency of results was validated by the Rayleigh scattering method, the full-waveform inversion, and the signal picking techniques. Promising results were obtained for the detection of clay content affecting the bearing capacity of sub-asphalt layers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boyce, Joe</author><author>Pozza, Matthew</author><author>Morris, William</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-resolution magnetic and seismic imaging of basement faults in western Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe, Canada</title><secondary-title>SAGEEP 2002</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SAGEEP 2002</full-title></periodical><volume>SAGEEP 200</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Boyce, Pozza, Morris -

Unfortunately, the great amount of manure produces leachate of nitrates and other ions which may affect groundwater quality. The objective of this paper was to identify the spatial distribution of bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) of non-saturated zone and its association with variability of nitrates and bioavailable phosphorous, water content, topography and electrical conductivity of saturated paste extract (EC). The analysis of the impact was done at two pens with different time of confinement of the animals (Pen1 and Pen 2, with 16 months and 7 years of animal occupation, respectively). The initial exploration phase was done by electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys were subsequently performed at a subarea for studying the spatial distribution of ECb. A grid of soil sampling up to 1 m depth was done at the same subarea of the EMI survey. A geostatistical interpolation of data was performed in order to map ECb, water content, nitrogen, bioavailable phosphorous and EC. Anomalies of higher conductivity (between 6 and 10 times the background values) were found near the feedbunk and the water trough, being greater on soils with larger period of manure recharge. Water content, nitrogen of nitrates (N-NO3−), bioavailable phosphorous (Pavail.) and EC showed patterns of spatial distribution similar to ECb. These patterns are mainly associated with the runoff movement of water to the lower zones in the case of a steeper slope and the soil compaction as in the Pen 1. In the Pen 2, the patterns of spatial variability are similar for ECb and water content while anomalies of high ECb were found along an abandoned feedbunk. High values of N-NO3−, Pavail. and EC were found at this site. A longer period of manure recharge resulted in higher values of nitrogen and bioavailable phosphorous in soils. It may be stated that bulk electrical conductivity was a good spatial indicator of water, nitrogen and bioavailable phosphorous in sandy loamy soils in these pens for the investigation depth of 1 m. The bulk conductivity seems to be primarily associated with water content which is the path of transport of ions through the porous medium. In all the cases, the major contents of nitrogen and bioavailable phosphorous in the soil were associated with high bulk electrical conductivity when water content was above an equivalent depth of water of 100 mm. The soil moisture status should be taken into account before an electromagnetic exploration for detecting soil contamination. Regarding the impact on groundwater pollution, the proximity of the water table to the surface seems to be more influential than the animal stocking rate for a longer period.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siegrist, Robert</author><author>Hargett, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of surface geophysics for location of buried hazardous wastes</title><secondary-title>Waste Management &amp; Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Waste Management &amp; Research</full-title></periodical><pages>325-355</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>1989</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Siegrist, Hargett -

Cost effective methodologies are required to characterize those deposits in order to identify better locations for groundwater abstraction. This study has investigated the potential use of combined electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) to characterize the heterogeneity and thickness of superficial deposits deployed along of a river. The ERT and HVSR methods are non-invasive geophysical techniques, simple, efficient, robust and easy-to-use in alluvial environment contexts. Using these geophysical methods in the Kou basin in Burkina Faso (West Africa), a good correspondence is obtained between ERT images and resonance frequencies determined on the HVSR profiles perpendicular to the Kou River. The superficial deposits and the bedrock depth have been characterized and mapped. The role of faulting and magmatic intrusions in the accumulation of fractured, deconsolidated and weathered bedrock materials and the filling of superficial deposits have been observed and highlighted. From a hydrogeological point of view, the thickness of (clay-free) superficial deposits presents a relatively important groundwater reservoir and potentially high productivity. The ERT and HVSR were proven to be efficient and complementary methods in superficial deposit environment characterization, and a viable option for exploration of superficial deposits in terms of groundwater reservoir in environments where the bedrock exhibits strong lateral variation due to faulting or volcanic activities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zohdy, A</author><author>Eaton, G</author><author>Mabey, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of surface geophysics to ground-water investigations</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>1980</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Zohdy, Eaton, Mabey - 1980 - Application of surface geophysics to ground-water investigations.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Che-Alota, Vukenkeng</author><author>Atekwana, Estella A</author><author>Atekwana, Eliot A</author><author>Sauck, William A</author><author>Werkema, D Dale</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal geophysical signatures from contaminant-mass remediation</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><pages>B113-B123</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.3139769</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Che-Alota et al. - 2009 - Temporal geophysical signatures from contaminant-mass remediation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ferre, Ty</author><author>Binley, A</author><author>Blasch, K</author><author>Callegary, J</author><author>Crawford, S</author><author>Fink, J</author><author>Flint, A</author><author>Hoffman, J</author><author>Izbicki, J</author><author>Levitt, M</author><author>Pool, D</author><author>Scanon, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical methods for investigation ground -water recharge</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ferre et al. - 2008 - Geophysical methods for investigation ground -water recharge.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crosbie, Russell S</author><author>Taylor, Andrew R</author><author>Davis, Aaron C</author><author>Lamontagne, Sébastien</author><author>Munday, Tim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of infiltration from losing-disconnected rivers using a geophysical characterisation of the riverbed and a simplified infiltration model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>HYDRUS</keyword><keyword>Recharge</keyword><keyword>Surface water–groundwater interactions</keyword></keywords><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.07.045</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Despite their significance to alluvial aquifer water balances, there are few field-derived estimates of infiltration from losing-disconnected rivers. Infiltration was estimated over a 2 km section of Billabong Creek (Murray-Darling Basin, Australia) using a combination of field measurements and modelling techniques. A method was developed whereby in-river and riverbank electrical resistivity surveys were used to map the spatial coverage and thickness of the riverbed clay layer, thought to be the key control on infiltration in this environment. Inverted resistivity measurements were used to generate a surrogate for a spatial map of clay layer thickness, with constraint provided by coring the riverbed at selected high and low resistivity locations to independently determine the thickness of the clay. The survey showed that the clay layer was continuous across the study reach but varied in thickness (∼1 m to &gt;4 m). A simple infiltration model was developed for infiltration through a clay layer and shown to be accurate under steady state conditions when compared to estimates obtained using a variable saturation numerical model for idealised riverbed cross-sections. Infiltration rates across the study reach were estimated to range between 1700 and 7800 m3 km–1 year–1, with an average of 3400 m3 km–1 year–1. A sensitivity analysis showed that infiltration rates were most sensitive to clay hydraulic conductivity, not clay layer thickness. However, it is anticipated that when applied at a larger scale (10 – 100 km), infiltration rates will be more sensitive to the presence or absence of a clay layer in the riverbed. The proposed methodology can provide independent estimates of infiltration in losing-disconnected rivers at a scale suitable for the calibration of regional groundwater models.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Power, Christopher</author><author>Gerhard, Jason I</author><author>Karaoulis, Marios</author><author>Tsourlos, Panagiotis</author><author>Giannopoulos, Antonios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating four-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography for monitoring DNAPL source zone remediation</title><secondary-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Contaminant Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>27-46</pages><volume>162–163</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>4D time-lapse monitoring</keyword><keyword>DNAPL</keyword><keyword>Electrical resistivity tomography</keyword><keyword>Geophysics</keyword><keyword>Remediation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0169-7722</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jconhyd.2014.04.004</electronic-resource-num><urls/></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Revil, Andre</author><author>Karaoulis, M</author><author>Johnson, T</author><author>Kemna, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Review: Some low-frequency electrical methods for subsurface characterization and monitoring in hydrogeology</title><secondary-title>Hydrogeology Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrogeology Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>617-658</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Springer</publisher><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Revil et al. -

The contaminants include Tetrachloroethylene (TCE) and Trichloroethylene (PCE), which, until recent years have been disposed of directly into the environment. The design of the surface and cross-borehole array allows for a 3D IP inversion. Data are measured at two frequencies (1/4 and 1/16 Hz), and are inverted for resistivity magnitude and phase. The inversion results are compared with PCE and TCE contaminant concentrations measured from core samples taken from three ground truthing wells drilled within the region of interest. The phase and imaginary resistivity are shown to be well correlated with the concentration data from two of the three ground truthing boreholes where the TCE and PCE concentrations are above 1mg/kg.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haarder, Eline B</author><author>Looms, Majken C</author><author>Jensen, Karsten H</author><author>Nielsen, Lars</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Visualizing Unsaturated Flow Phenomena Using High-Resolution Reflection Ground Penetrating Radar</title><secondary-title>Vadose Zone Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Vadose Zone Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>84</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1539-1663</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2136/vzj2009.0188</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Haarder et al. - 2011 - Visualizing Unsaturated Flow Phenomena Using High-Resolution Reflection Ground Penetrating Radar.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Catapano, Ilaria</author><author>Affinito, Antonio</author><author>Bertolla, Luciana</author><author>Porsani, Jorge Luís</author><author>Soldovieri, Francesco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Oil spill monitoring via microwave tomography enhanced GPR surveys</title><secondary-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><pages>95-103</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Controlled LNAPL spill</keyword><keyword>Experiment</keyword><keyword>Full 3D imaging</keyword><keyword>GPR</keyword><keyword>Inverse scattering</keyword><keyword>Microwave tomography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0926-9851</isbn><electronic-resource-num>/10.1016/j.jappgeo.2014.06.017</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Oil spill detection and monitoring deserve huge attention in environmental protection as well as for timely planning maintenance actions, with the final aim to mitigate soil pollution. In this frame, the requirement for detailed subsurface diagnostics, while performing non-invasive surveys, motivates the use of ground penetrating radar (GPR) systems and their continuous development in order to improve the achievable performance. Moving in this direction, this paper aims at investigating the reconstruction capabilities of a full 3D microwave tomography approach as a tool for pollution characterization and imaging. The microwave tomography approach exploits a Born Approximation based model of the electromagnetic scattering phenomenon and is capable of accounting for the vectorial nature of the wave–material interaction. The reconstruction capabilities are assessed against experimental data referred to oil spill in dry and water saturated sand soils, gathered in laboratory controlled conditions at the Department of Geophysics of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. The provided results state that the full 3D microwave tomography approach is able to gain accurate images of the surveyed scenarios allowing to acquire information on the oil diffusion process in both the considered soils.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Williams, K G</author><author>Ntarlagiannis, D</author><author>Slater, L D</author><author>Hohnalkova, S S</author><author>Hubbard, S S</author><author>Banfield, J F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geophysical imaging of stimulated microbial biomineralization</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>7592-7600</pages><volume>39</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Williams et al. - 2005 - Geophysical imaging of stimulated microbial biomineralization.webarchive</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slater, L D</author><author>Glaser, D R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controls on induced polarization in sandy unconsolidated sediments and application to aquifer characterization</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><pages>1547-1558</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2003</year></dates><isbn>0016-8033</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/1.1620628</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Slater, Glaser - 2003 - Controls on induced polarization in sandy unconsolidated sediments and application to aquifer characterization.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandberg, S</author><author>Slater, L</author><author>Versteeg, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrated geophysical investigation of the hydrogeology of an anistropic unconfined aquifer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>227-243</pages><volume>267</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2002</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Sandberg, Slater, Versteeg - 2002 - An integrated geophysical investigation of the hydrogeology of an anistropic unconfined aquifer.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Irving, James</author><author>Knight, Rosemary</author><author>Holliger, Klaus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of the lateral correlation structure of subsurface water content from surface-based ground-penetrating radar reflection images</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Research</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a</pages><volume>45</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2008WR007471</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Irving, Knight, Holliger - 2009 - Estimation of the lateral correlation structure of subsurface water content from surface-based ground-.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clément, R.</author><author>Oxarango, L.</author><author>Descloitres, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contribution of 3-D time-lapse ERT to the study of leachate recirculation in a landfill</title><secondary-title>Waste Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Waste Management</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>0956-053X</isbn><accession-num>21106360</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.wasman.2010.09.005</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Leachate recirculation is a key process in the operation of municipal waste landfills as bioreactors. It aims at increasing the moisture content to optimise the biodegradation. Because waste is a very heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media, the geometry of the leachate plume recirculation is difficult to delineate from the surface at the scale of the bioreactor site. In this study, 3-D time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to obtain useful information for understanding leachate recirculation hydrodynamics. The ERT inversion methodology and the electrode arrays were optimised using numerical modelling simulating a 3-D leachate injection scenario. Time-lapse ERT was subsequently applied at the field scale during an experimental injection. We compared ERT images with injected volumes to evaluate the sensitivity of time-lapse ERT to delineate the plume migration. The results show that time-lapse ERT can accomplish the following: (i) accurately locate the injection plume, delineating its depth and lateral extension; (ii) be used to estimate some hydraulic properties of waste. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl" path="Drupal export 10-17-18.enl">Drupal export 10-17-18.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Timothy C.</author><author>Versteeg, Roelof J.</author><author>Day-Lewis, Frederick D.</author><author>Major, William</author><author>Lane, John W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation</title><secondary-title>Groundwater</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25457440</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gwat.12291</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Johnson et al. - 2015 - Time-Lapse Electrical Geophysical Monitoring of Amendment-Based Biostimulation.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Biostimulation is increasingly used to accelerate microbial remediation of recalcitrant groundwater contaminants. Effective application of biostimulation requires successful emplacement of amendment in the contaminant target zone. Verification of remediation performance requires postemplacement assessment and contaminant monitoring. Sampling-based approaches are expensive and provide low-density spatial and temporal information. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is an effective geophysical method for determining temporal changes in subsurface electrical conductivity. Because remedial amendments and biostimulation-related biogeochemical processes often change subsurface electrical conductivity, ERT can complement and enhance sampling-based approaches for assessing emplacement and monitoring biostimulation-based remediation. Field studies demonstrating the ability of time-lapse ERT to monitor amendment emplacement and behavior were performed during a biostimulation remediation effort conducted at the Department of Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) Yard, in Brandywine, Maryland, United States. Geochemical fluid sampling was used to calibrate a petrophysical relation in order to predict groundwater indicators of amendment distribution. The petrophysical relations were field validated by comparing predictions to sequestered fluid sample results, thus demonstrating the potential of electrical geophysics for quantitative assessment of amendment-related geochemical properties. Crosshole radar zero-offset profile and borehole geophysical logging were also performed to augment the data set and validate interpretation. In addition to delineating amendment transport in the first 10 months after emplacement, the time-lapse ERT results show later changes in bulk electrical properties interpreted as mineral precipitation. Results support the use of more cost-effective surface-based ERT in conjunction with limited field sampling to improve spatial and temporal monitoring of amendment emplacement and remediation performance.</abstract></record></records></xml>
